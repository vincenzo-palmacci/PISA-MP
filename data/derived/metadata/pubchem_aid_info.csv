It is most often caused through unintended block of the cardiac repolarizing potassium channel, IKr, encoded by the Human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) [4]. hERG is susceptible to inhibition by even transient exposure to a diverse array of common therapeutic compounds, including antihistamines, antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antiarrhythmics which in turn provokes the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia torsades de pointes in predisposed individuals. Indeed, several successful drugs (e.g., cisapride, seldane) had to be withdrawn from the market due to arrhythmia development caused by this mechanism [5-8]. Previous studies have shown that Ikr can be protected from block by known hERG antagonists through the activity of the K+ channel regulator 1 (KCR1) protein, which was characterized as an enzyme that is likely to function in the cellular glycosylation pathway[9, 10]. This finding led to a hypothesis that identification of a small molecule that mimics the activity of KCR1 and diminishes Ikr block by known hERG inhibitors may lead to the development of a co-drug to protect against the development of the aLQTS. Compounds that exhibit such activity would be expected to include neutral antagonists that bind to the same site as hERG blockers but do not favor the ""blocked conformation"" of the pore, hERG agonists that competitively bind to the same site as hERG inhibitors, or compounds that prevent the access of a hERG inhibitor to its cognate binding site at the intracellular aspect of the pore region. High-throughput methods are used to:  1. Screen a library of 305,722 compounds for agents that increase the IC70 of the well-characterized hERG inhibitor, dofetilide, using a high-throughput Tl+ flux assay [11-13]. The Tl+ ion serves as a surrogate for K+ flux, and, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader. A robust and reproducible assay in 384-well format has been developed to show a dose-dependent signal in response to dofetilide and tolerance to the compound vehicle, DMSO. Completion of a preliminary screen using 3,520 compounds demonstrated that the assay is ready to identify chemical compounds that alter the response of Ikr to dofetilide [14-17].  2. Determine if the isolated hits also affect the IC70 of a range of drugs with divergent chemical structures (moxifloxacin, clozapine[18], droperidol [5-6,19-21]) and clinical applications in the Tl+ flux assay.  These findings will be validated through standard patch-clamp assays. Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) studies will be initiated around the most interesting chemical scaffolds.  The development of a small molecule chemical agent that could be safely co-administered with clinically useful pharmaceuticals to protect susceptible patients from hERG inhibitors and the subsequent development of arrhythmias would improve public health and greatly facilitate the drug discovery process.   Principle of the assay  Tl+ is permeable through potassium channels. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells and exhibits very low basal fluorescence in the absence of Tl+. Upon depolarization of cells expressing potassium channels, in this case, human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through activated hERG channels. The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of hERG is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increases; however, when the hERG channel is blocked by a test compound, low or no increase of the fluorescent signal is observed.  1.

This assay employs a CHO cell line that stably expresses hERG channels.  The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the hERG channel were measured in the presence of IC70 of dofetilide by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit.  The CHO cells stably expressing hERG channels were plated into 384-well plates.  The following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR,and then incubated with assay buffer.  Compounds with IC70 of dofetilide were added to assay buffer.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and then depolarized by incubation with 5 mM K2SO4 and 1.4 mM Tl2SO4.  Fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.  Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio normalized with negative controls.  If the compound causes 5*SD, or more activity increase, the compound is considered to be active.   Protocol for the HERG project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50ug/ml streptomycin,and 500ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells 5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in the dark 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer containing IC70 of dofetilide; controls are assay buffer, IC70, and ICmax of dofetilide (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds) 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in the dark 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 25 mM K2SO4 and 7 mM Tl2SO4 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds 14. Calculate F(max-min)/F0 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate 16. Calculate the percentage with the following formula:     Percentage = Inhibition (%) - (Avg+5*SD)      Where      Percentage: percentage change of compound readout over those of negative controls with dofetilide with a concentration of its IC70 and 5 times of its standard deviation.      Inhibition (%): percentage of the compound readout normalized to those of the blank control without stimulus buffer (0) and negative control without inhibitors (100%).      Avg: average of inhibition (%) of those of negative controls with dofetilide with a concentration of its IC70.      SD: standard deviation of inhibition (%) of those of negative controls with dofetilide with a concentration of its IC70. 17.

Based on the critical role of SK in GAS pathogenicity, we are attempting to identify chemical compounds that specifically reduce the expression of bacterial SK, without interfering with bacterial viability. Specifically, a probe is a small molecule that shows no less than one hundred fold selection for the primary strain (SKKanGAS, see below) vs a control strain SK(-)GAS (see below) in growth-based assays and shows significant inhibition of SK secretion in abiochemical assay that measure SK activity.  The more potent and specific probe will be used to further explore the role of SK in GAS pathogenicity.  Assay Overview: Assay:  The strain used for this project is a GAS strain carrying the kanamycin resistant gene under the control of the streptokinase promoter (SKKanGAS). Compounds that inhibit streptokinase promoter activity lead to a decrease of the kanamycin resistant gene product and cell death in the presence of kanamycin (Sigma K1637).  Briefly, SKKanGAS at OD600 equal to  0.015 were plated onto 384-well plates (Corning 3570) and incubated with test compounds (7.5 uM, 0.2%DMSO) in the presence of 40 ug/ml of kanamycin in Todd-Hewitt Broth medium for 6 hours before cell survival is assessed by BacTiterGlo reagent (Promega G8233).   Selectivity is determined by comparing growth inhibition between SKKanGAS and another GAS strain, SK(-)GAS where the kanamycin resistant gene is under the control of an SK-independent promoter.  Outcome:  A decrease in the luminescent signal will identify compounds that either inhibit the SK promoter, or inhibit the cell growth independent of inhibiting the SK promoter. Normalization of the HTS data across runs and calibration to the positive control was performed as described below.  The results are reported as % inhibition.  Specificity for SK promoter inhibition will be determined in a secondary assay where a GAS strain carrying kanamycin resistant gene which is not controlled by the SK promoter will be used.","Assay Protocol: Day 1 Streak out SKKanGAS for colonies on THY/S/S agar plate (Todd-Hewitt Broth with streptomycin 100 ug/mL, spectinomycin 100 ug/ml, 1.5% agar); 37oC O/N Day 2 Grow an overnight culture in THY/S/S from a single colony, 37oC O/N Day 3 Measure OD600 of the overnight culture (typically over OD600 1.2), and then dilute 1:20 into fresh THY/S/S in a flask.

","This assay belongs to specific project (2014, MLPCN Streptokinase Expression Inhibition ) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard  HTS Data Analysis: Negative control wells (DMSO) were included on every plate.  Two plates containing the positive control at various doses were included in every assay run.  In order to provide a consistent calibration for all runs, we defined the positive control value to be the value observed when the positive control was present at 1.2974uM.   The PubChem_Activity_Score was derived using the follow procedure:  1. A background-subtracted value was calculated for each well by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells on each plate from the value of each well on that plate.    2. Systematic plate effects were corrected for each run.  A plate effect correction matrix was derived by calculating the median value of all non-positive-control wells for each well location (e.g. C07) across all the plates in a run.  This correction matrix was then smoothed using an inverse-distance weighted median filter and subtracted from all wells on the plates in the same run resulting in a background-subtracted, plate-effect-corrected value for each well.  3. An activity score was derived for each well by dividing the background-subtracted, plate-effect-corrected value for each well by the median of the background-subtracted, plate-effect-corrected value of the positive control wells in the same run and multiplying the resulting fraction by 100.  4.

PBS is used in place of CellTiter-Glo Buffer thus preventing platelet lysis and a high background of ATP.  Luminescence measurements are taken 15 minutes after reagent addition.  Outcome:  A decrease in the luminescent signal will identify compounds that either inhibit the release of dense granules from the platelets, or inhibit the luciferase enzyme.  Normalization of the HTS data across runs and calibration to the positive was performed as described below.  The results are reported as % inhibition.  Specificity for platelet inhibition will be determined in a secondary assay. ","Assay Protocol:  Taken from 2016-01-A01-01 through 2016-01-A01-11   1)    Plasma bag(s) from a single donor were emptied into a sterile bottle (250 or 500ml, depending on volume of plasma) in a hood.  If multiple bags exist from a single donor (matching barcodes), they were combined as to increase batch volume.  Multiple donors' samples could not be pooled due to possible immunological reactions, therefore multiple batches were run daily with each being prepared singly.  All information provided on each unit used was recorded (source, donor number,blood type, etc.). 2)    Samples were taken to count the number of platelets/ml and checked for activation activity by addition of SFLLRN and CellTiter-Glo. 3)    The Thermo MultiDrop Combi in the hood was prepared for dispensing 20ul of plasma per well.  As many plates allowable with volume of plasma were filled from a single donor.  Batch size ranged from 200ml-700ml.  While filling, platelets were kept in homogeneous suspension by gentle agitation. 4)    Assay plates were loaded into racks for placement into a Liconic STR240 HRIT incubator set at 30'C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2.  The incubator is docked to the screening system.  Compound plates have their foil seals pierced off-line.  Those plates are loaded into a Liconic STR240 DRIT incubator set to 22'C, 15% humidity. 5)    CellTiter-Glo/SFLLRN was prepared for each day to a volume to accommodate the number of assay plates estimated for the day.  The CellTiter-Glo Substrate was previously resuspended in 100ml PBS, aliquoted and frozen.  An aliquot was thawed and diluted 1:4 with PBS.  SFLLRN was previously resuspended in a stocks of 10mM and frozen.  An aliquot was thawed and was added to the mixture at 15#M.  The Combi on the screening system was prepared for run and primed with the reagent. 6)    Screening was performed on an enclosed, contained screening system.  The run was initiated by set-up in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform) and scheduled with Cellario (HighRes Biosolutions).  Staubli arms moved plates from the different instruments on the system.  Compounds were pinned into assay plates using a MicroPin (High Res Biosolutions) using a 25nl head calibrated to deliver 50nl. 7)    Assay plates were returned to the incubator for a 30 min. incubation. 7)    At the completion of incubation, plates moved to the Combi for addition of 10ul CellTiter-Glo/SFLLRN solution per well.  8)    Plates were moved to a plate hotel on deck for a 15 min. incubation. 9)    At completion of incubation, plates were moved to an Envision 2104 Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer) for luminescence detection.  The ultra sensitive detection was used, with the 1536 aperture in place, to decrease bleed-through from adjacent wells.  Read time is 0.1s/well.  ","This assay belongs to specific project (2016, MLPCN Platelet Activation) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard  HTS Data Analysis:  Negative control wells (DMSO) were included on every plate. Two plates containing the positive control at various doses were included in every assay run.  The PubChem_Activity_Score was derived using the follow procedure:  1. Negative controls:  The median value of the negative control wells was calculated for each plate.  2. Positive controls: In this screen,  some of the positive control plates failed due to automation errors while the compound plates from the same runs did not.  In runs where the positive control plates did not fail, the data value at maximum inhibition was consistently 4% of the value of the negative controls.  In order to provide a consistent calibration for all runs, we defined the positive control value for each run to be 4% of the median value of the negative control wells in that run.  3. A background-subtracted value was calculated for each well by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells on each plate (from step 1) from the value of each well on that plate.  4. Systematic plate effects were corrected for each run.  A plate effect correction matrix was derived by calculating the median value of all non-positive-control wells for each well location (e.g. C07) across all the plates in a run.  This correction matrix was then smoothed using an inverse-distance weighted median filter and subtracted from all the plates in the same run resulting in a background-subtracted, plate-effect-corrected value for each well.  5. A background-subtracted positive control value was calculated for each run by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells in that run from the positive control value calculated earlier (step 2).  An activity score was derived for each well by  dividing the background subtracted, plate effect corrected value (step 4) by the background-subtracted positive control value and multiplying the resulting fraction by 100.  5. The final PubChem_Activity_Score represents the mean of all valid replicate activity scores obtained.  Range of -189 to 182.  The PubChem_Activity_Outcome class was assigned as described below:  Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive) PubChem_Activity_Score <50 and all replicate activity scores <50.  Activity_Outcome = 2 (active) PubChem_Activity_Score >=50.  Using this cutoff, the  PubChem_Activity_Score for the active compounds is greater than the 99.93 percentile of the PubChem_Activity_Outcomeof the negative controls.

However, the number of ion channel drugs is strikingly small, compared to the number of ion channel genes.  Most of the known K+ channel modulators lack potency and specificity.  The reason for slow development of K+ channel drugs lies largely in the low capacity and high cost of electrophysiology-based screening techniques.  The overall goal of the project is to discover inhibitors of the Kir2.1 channel with EC50 < 1 uM.  Identified compounds will serve as both a basis for development of clinical K+ channel drugs, and as a basic study of K+ channel physiology with novel mechanisms of action.  The Kir2.1 channel (KCNJ2) is a member of inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, expressing two transmembrane-spanning segments, flanking a conserved pore region.  Inward rectifier K+ channels pass prominent inward currents, and mediate the cardiac inwardly-rectifying potassium current (IK1) [3], while outward currents are largely blocked.  The rectification process is mediated through blocking of the channel pore by intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines, and is specific for individual Kir subtypes [4, 5].  Specific modulators of the Kir2.1 channel serve as leads for development of anti-arrhythmic drugs, including drugs for treatment of short- and long-QT syndromes, as well as for the treatment of Andersen syndrome.  Several Kir2.1 inhibitor candidates have been discovered [6] [7], i.e. Chlorpromazine, Celastrol, and Gambogic acid.  However, a highly specific, high potency small molecule is still in need, not only for the mechanistic probing of the ion channel activities, but also to generate leads for therapeutics for related diseases.  Principle of the assay The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [8].  The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence.  Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels--in this case, inwardly-rectifying potassium ion channels (Kir2.1)--extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open Kir2.1 channels, and when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [9, 10].  If the activity of Kir2.1 is blocked/inhibited by a test compound, the fluorescent signal remains low/does not increase.

This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses Kir2.1 channels.  The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR.  As designed, compound effects on the Kir2.1 channel were measured by thallium assay, using the FluxOR detection kit, a commercial kit.  Those HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer.  Compounds were added to the assay buffer.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and detected upon the addition of stimulus solution (5 mM K2SO4 and 1.4 mM Tl2SO4).  The fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.  Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls.  If the compound causes less than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an inhibitor/blocker of the Kir2.1 channels.   Protocol for the Kir2.1 project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50ug/ml streptomycin, and 500ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 300,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul/well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells 5. Incubate 90 minutes, at room temperature (RT), in the dark 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (IC0), and IC100 of Chlorpromaizne (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds)  7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul/well of assay buffer to cells 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system  9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in the dark 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 25 mM K2SO4 and 7 mM Tl2SO4 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 13. Add 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer onto cells and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0  15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' prime factors [11]. 16. Calculate B scores [12] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is less than minus 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (<=-3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 2 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active as an inhibitor/blocker of the Kir2.1 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive.  18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation of 100*(0- Integer ([B Score Inhibitor Ratio]))/20, B Score Inhibitor Ratio, as in the result definition. Among the active compounds in the assay, the activity  score range is 95-20. All inactive test compounds are assigned to the score 0.  List of reagents  1.

The 5'UTR of alpha-synuclein mRNA can interact with Iron Regulatory Protein-1 (IRP1), which upon interaction causes an increase in alpha-synuclein mRNA translation. Probes that can successfully reduce alpha-synuclein expression levels as measured in this luciferase reporter assay will be further tested for specificity in cells lacking the alpha-synuclein 5'UTR stem-loop to confirm that probes are acting through the intended target. Probe selectivity will be tested in cells containing the prion protein 5'UTR mRNA stem-loop fused to a luciferase reporter.  Assay Overview:  Compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid containing alpha-synuclein 5'UTR-luciferase gene fusion (Jack Rogers).  Compounds that cause a reduction in luciferase expression will be further tested for proper target binding and specificity.

Five mL of complete media was then added and mixed by pipetting up and down.  This 10 mL of cell solution was then aspirated and added to a conical tube and cells were pelleted for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge.  The media was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL fresh complete media.  Cells were then counted and expanded (see below). 3) Cells were expanded by plating 1x10^6 cells in 35 mL complete media per T175 flask (generally used 20xT175 flasks per 200 assay plate run) and allowing 72 h for cells to grow to confluency. 4) Cells were harvested as above, but were resuspended in phenol-red free complete media (phenol red-free DMEM with 4.5 g/L D-glucose (Lonza, 12-917F) supplemented with 10 % FBS (Lonza, 14-503E), 200 uM L-glutamine (Lonza, 17-605E), 100 uM penstrep (Lonza, 17-602E) and 200 ug/mL geneticin (Invitrogen, 10131-027)) and then were diluted to 60,000 cells/mL in phenol-red free complete media prewarmed to 37 C in 1 L sterile plastic bottles.  5) Cells were plated into 384-well plates (batch size = 200-220 assay plates) at 3,000 cells/well in 50 uL phenol-red free complete media using a Thermo MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser and a sterilized dispensing cassette and stir bar, in a TC hood. 6) Assay plates were loaded into 22 slot holders which were then placed into an online Liconic (STX 2201C) incubator set to 37 C, 95 % humidity, 5 % CO2, and were incubated overnight. 7) Screening was performed using an open system (HiRes Biosolutions).

Thus, post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts by maternally supplied RNA-binding proteins is crucial to early patterning events. Few tools exist to study specific regulatory networks guided by RNA-binding proteins during early development. Importantly, standard genetic analyses are complicated by the maternal effect, pleiotropy, and embryonic lethality.  This screen aims to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNA-binding protein function for two proteins required for Caenorhabditis elegans early development. The rationale was two fold. First, inhibitory compounds would serve as a set of chemical tools to facilitate study of the RNA-binding proteins during subsequent aspects of development. Second, if the inhibitory compounds function across nematode species boundaries, then they may be useful as a new class of anti-parasitic agent that specifically targets Helminth embryos notoriously difficult to inactivate.  The two proteins chosen, MEX-5 and POS-1, belong to a family of conserved nematode CCCH class tandem zinc finger proteins. Both are critical to body axis formation and segregation of the germline from the soma.  MEX-5 coordinates anterior cell fate specification, while POS-1 coordinates posterior patterning and germline specification.  Both proteins can be expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as recombinant fusion proteins, and both proteins bind with high affinity to specific RNA sequences in vitro.  Finally, fluorescence polarization can be used to effectively monitor the in vitro RNA-binding activity of both proteins using a standard fluorescence plate reader.  1) Probe attributes  Small molecule that inhibits MEX-5  Works as a transient inactivator  Kills embryos  Does not bind to other zinc-finger proteins   Assay Overview: The ability of purified MEX-5 protein to change the anisotropy of fluorescently labeled RNAs upon binding is used as the basis of the assay. This biochemical assay will be used to screen for inhibitors of this interaction.","2024-01-W01-03 7.5 nL of compound per well was pre-dispensed into black Aurora 1536 low-base plates (PN 00029844) in duplicate assay plates.  Pre-dispensed plates were stored lidded at room temperature for up to two weeks. MEX-5 protein, expressed in E. coli JM109 with a C-terminal fusion to maltose binding protein, was prepared by the assay provider at approximately 50 uM as previously described.  A protein master mix was prepared at 200 nM in 1x buffer (20 mM tris pH 8.0 (Ambion), 40 mM NaCl (Ambion), 0.004% IPEGAL (Sigma), 100 uM zinc acetate dihydrate (Fluka)).  The solution was loaded on the dispenser (Combi nL, Thermo) at room temperature.   The target binding sequence TCR2 is a Temporal Control Region in the 3' untranslated region of the C. elegans gene glp-1 (abnormal Germ Line Proliferation).  Fluorescent TCR2 RNA (5'-UUUCUUUAUAACUUGUUACAAUUUUUGAAA-FITC-3', Dharmacon / Thermo) mastermix was prepared in 1x buffer and supplemented with 0.02 mg/mL tRNA type X (Sigma).  The RNA mastermix was heated at 65 degrees for 2 minutes then cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr, Beckman Coulter) at room temperature.  The dispenser bottle was wrapped in foil to protect from light. Competing unlabeled TCR2 RNA (Dharmacon / Thermo) was prepared as a positive control solution at 25 uM in 1x buffer.  The solution was heated to 65 degrees for 2 minutes and cooled on ice prior to loading onto the dispenser (BioRaptr) at room temperature. 1x buffer alone was also prepared and loaded onto the dispenser (BioRaptr). The assay plates with pre-dispensed compound were filled with 4.5 uL / well of protein mastermix on the Combi nL and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then filled on the Bioratpr with 1.5 uL / well of labeled RNA mastermix and either 1.5 uL / well of 1x buffer only (compound wells and negative control DMSO wells) or 1.5 uL / well of competing RNA in 1x buffer (positive control wells). The final assay concentrations in 7.5 uL total volume were: 20 mM tris pH 8.0 40 mM NaCl 0.004% IPEGAL 100 uM zinc acetate 120 nM MEX5 protein 2 nM FITC labeled TCR2 RNA 4 ug/mL tRNA type X 10 uM test compound, 0.1% DMSO For positive control wells: 5 uM unlabeled TCR2 RNA   Plates were spun at 1000 rpm (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6KR, GH3.8 rotor) for one minute. One hour after the addition of the RNA to the plates, fluorescence polarization was read on a ViewLux reader (Perkin Elmer).  Total fluorescence from the P and S polarization channels was recorded along with the Fluorescence Polarization calculation.","HTS Data Analysis: 128 negative control wells (DMSO) were included on every plate.  32 positive control wells (5 uM competing unlabaled RNA target TCR2) were included on every plate.  Compound activity was scaled to these values, with DMSO activity measuring 0% and the competing RNA measuring 100% activity.  Automatic masking of spot patterns was performed by Genedata software to remove bleed-over signal from very highly fluorescent wells.  Pattern correction was performed by Genedata software using a runwise additive algorithm. Total fluorescence intensity in the P and S was normalized to the negative control wells on each plate.    The PubChem_Activity_Score was derived using the follow procedure:  1. A background-subtracted value was calculated for each well by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells on each plate from the value of each well on that plate.  2. An activity score was derived for each well by dividing the background-subtracted value for each well by the median of the background-subtracted value of the positive control wells in the same run and multiplying the resulting fraction by 100.  3. Runwise patterns were smoothed using an additive algorithm in Genedata software  4. The final PubChem_Activity_Score represents the mean of all valid replicate activity scores obtained.  The PubChem_Activity_Outcome class was assigned as described below:  Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive) PubChem_Activity_Score for more than half the replicate activity scores <25.  Activity_Outcome = 2 (active) PubChem_Activity_Score for more than half the replicate activity scores > 25 and average total fluorescence intensity values in the S channel less than twice the median S channel fluorescence intensity of the negative controls on each plate.  Activity_Outcome = 3 (inconclusive) PubChem_Activity_Score > 25 for half the replicate activity scores and < 25 for half; or average total fluorescence intensity in the S channel > twice the median S channel fluorescence intensity of the negative controls on each plate.  5.

1875,"This bioassay record (AID 1875) belongs to the assay project ""Summary of Probe Development Efforts to Identify Inhibitors of Polyadenylation"", which is associated with the summary AID 1881 and a total of 8 additional BioAssay records in PubChem.","Keywords: mRNA maturation, polyadenylation, reporter gene assay, yeast, gene expression  Assay:  Yeast which harbor a reporter construct will be screened for elevated levels of beta-galactosidase activity using the luminescent signal from the GalScreen assay.  Briefly, cells are lysed after incubation with compounds using the GalScreen reagent and then the luminescent signal is read on a plate reader.  Expected Outcome:  Compounds which perturb polyadenylation will produce an elevated level of luminescent signal.  Toxic compounds and compounds that completely inhibit polyadenylation will not be detectable.  In order to identify inhibitors of polyadenylation (Poly-A), yeast containing a reporter gene plasmid construct will be used for screening.  The pL101 plasmid contains a Poly-A site within an intron of the reporter gene construct (alcoholdehydrogenase (ADH2), containing the intron, upstream of  beta-galactosidase) and a Poly-A sequence at the reporter gene terminus.  When normal fidelity mRNA polyadenylation is the case, the intron will not be fully transcribed, since the poly-A site within the intron of the adh gene will cause the reporter gene mRNA to be matured prior to lac-Z transcription.  When Poly-A is inhibited, however, there will be readthrough of the first site, transcription of the full construct, and some maturation of the reporter gene.  So there should be  low levels of a beta-galactosidase reporter enzyme when polyadenylation is in its normal, uninhibited state and when polyadenylation is perturbed, higher levels.    The plasmid is described in Hyman, L. E., et al. Molecular and Cellular Biology (1991) 11, 4; 2004-2012.  The assay suffers from the drawback that if polyadenylation is completely inhibited, there will be no maturation of the reporter construct and thus no signal.    Positive control compound (Parish, C. A., et al, JACS (2008) 130, 22, 7060) is unavailable and the assay is, thus, impossible to fully optimize.","There are three yeast lines which may be used for this screen; SKY197 (MATa ura3 his3 trp1 1LexA-operator-Leu-2 lamdacI-operator-Lys-2 pdr1::GAL1pro-HXT9 pdr3::GAL1pro-HXT11), SKY54 (MATa ura3 his3 trp1 3LexA-operator-Leu-2 lamdacIoperator-Lys-2 pdr1::GAL1pro-HXT9 pdr3::GAL1pro-HXT11), and wildtype.  The SKY197 an SKY54 have two genes (pdr1 and pdr3), transcription factors of the PDR network system, deleted from their genomes  (Kato-Stankiewicz, J., et al. PNAS (2002) 99, 22; 14398-14403).  It is hoped that a poor xenobiotic efflux system will improve the likelihood of identifying active compounds that might otherwise not reach detectable concentrations within the cells.  A disadvantage of this approach is increasing the overall apparent toxicity of compounds.  From 2015-01-A01-01  1)  An overnight culture of SKY197-pL101 prepared in 100 ml CM-Ura Gal medium and grown at 30'C 250 rpm in a 250 ml flask is used to prepare a screening culture of OD600 0.02 in the medium.  Overnight cultures with OD600 values >2.0 are considered overgrown and not used.  CM-Ura Gal Medium is prepared by autoclaving 6.7 g Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biologicals Y2025) 2 g Dropout Mix Synthetic Minus Uracil w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biologicals D9535) adjusted to pH 7 with 3.7 ml 1 M NaOH in 900 ml and then adding, once cooled, 100 ml 20% sterile filtered Galactose (Acros 150610010).  2)  20 ul / well screening culture is added from a stirred reservoir to a white lidded 384 well plate (Aurora 00030521 Solid bottom, Square well, Sterile, Untreated) using a Multidrop Combi (Thermo Electron Corp.) with a standard cassette on medium speed.  3)  25 nl compound is transfered from the library plates to the assay plates via pintool (V&P Scientific) for a nominal screening concentration of 12 uM.  4)  Plates are incubated for 9 hrs 30'C high humidity (3 doublings).  5)  30 ul / well GalScreen (Applied Biosystems T1031) reagent is added using a Multidrop Combi with a standard cassette on high speed.  6)  Plates are incubated 25'C 1 hr to develop signal.  7)  Luminescence is measured 0.1 s read time / well using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).  Increased luminescent signal is expected if polyadenylation is perturbed.  Decreased signals may be observed where compounds decrease either the growth rate of the yeast or are toxic.","HTS Data Analysis:  Negative control wells (DMSO) were included on every plate.  The PubChem_Activity_Score was derived using the follow procedure:  1. A background-subtracted value was calculated for each well by subtracting the mean value of the negative control wells on each plate from the value of each well on that plate.   2. A z-score was calculated by dividing this background-subtracted value by the standard deviation of the negative controls wells from the same plate.  3. Systematic plate effects were corrected for each run by using the ""Runwise Pattern (Additive)"" correction method of Genedata Screener Assay Analyzer (v.6.0.1).  4. A scaled activity score was derived for each well by dividing this background-subtracted, plate-effect-corrected z-score by 6 and then multiplying the resulting value by 100.  The affect of this scaling is that a well that has a value 6 times the standard deviation of the negative control wells greater than the mean of the negative control wells has a scaled value of 100.  5.

Strosberg, TSRI External Assay ID: HCVCORE_INH_HTRF_1536_1X%INH  Name: TR-FRET-based primary biochemical high-throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) core protein dimerization.  Description:  The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver failure and hepatocellular cancer, with about 170 million people infected worldwide (1). The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9).  References:  1.

In this assay, test compounds are incubated with N-terminally tagged GST-core106 and Flag-core106 peptides, followed by addition of a Europium cryptate-tagged anti-GST antibody and a XL-665-tagged anti-Flag antibody. Dimerization of the core106 peptides and subsequent antibody binding brings the antibody tags into close proximity, allowing FRET from the Europium donor to the XL-665 acceptor, resulting in an increase in well FRET. As designed, compounds that inhibit core106 dimerization will prevent the interaction of the tagged antibodies, blocking the transfer of energy from Europium to XL-665, and thus inhibiting well FRET. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 200 mM Potassium Fluoride, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.05% BSA, pH 7.45, filtered at 0.22 micrometer) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. The remaining 46 columns were filled with 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 225 ng/mL of Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and 42.5 nM of Flag-Core106. Next, 1 microliter of inhibition controls were dispensed into column 3 (12.5 micromolar unlabelled core106 protein, 100% inhibition), column 46 (200 nM core106 protein, 50% inhibition), and columns 4 to 45, 47 and 48 (Assay Buffer alone). Twenty-five nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were then added to the appropriate wells. Next, 2 microliters of Assay Buffer supplemented with 2.5 micrograms/mL XL665-anti FLAG antibody and 33.75 nM GST-Core106 were dispensed to columns 3 to 48. The assay plates were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 300g and incubated for 4 hours at 22.5 degrees Celsius. At the end of the incubation time, TR-FRET was measured by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 617 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). All wells had a final volume of 5 microliters. The final reagent concentrations were 90 ng/mL Eu(K)-anti GST antibody, 1 microgram/mL XL665-anti FLAG, 17 nM Flag-Core106 and 13.5 nM GST-Core106. Final control concentrations were 2.5 micromolar and 40 nM for the 100% and 50% inhibition controls, respectively.  To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = ( I671nm / I617nm ) x 10,000  Where I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nanometers.  The percent inhibition for each compound is reported as the average and the standard deviation of three replicate wells, calculated as follows:  % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound # Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing no GST-core106. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing 1 micromolar of unlabelled Core106 protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported Pubchem_Activity_Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The inactive compounds of this assay have an activity score range of 0 to 41 and the active compounds have an activity score range of 41 to 100.

These enzymes are characterized in part by their post-translational removal of leucine, aspartate, proline, methionine, etc from proteins and peptides, in order that proteins are properly regulated, targeted for degradation, and trafficked within both animal and plant cells (3). As a result, these enzymes are involved in diverse processes, including meiosis (1), cellular senescence (1), blood pressure control (4, 5), angiogenesis (6), and inflammation (7). PFM18AAP is the sole aspartyl aminopeptidase (AAP) present in the genome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (8). It exhibits exopeptidase activity exclusively against the N-terminal acidic amino acids glutamate and aspartate (9-11), is found in all intra-erythrocytic stages of the parasite (9), and functions to complete the hydrolysis of host hemoglobin into amino acids for use in de novo protein synthesis by the parasite (12, 13). Studies demonstrating that genetic knockdown of PFM18AAP results in a lethal parasite phenotype (9), and that inhibitors of methionine (14) and leucine (12, 15) aminopeptidases prevent malaria growth in culture and hemoglobin degradation, suggest that these enzymes are essential for parasite survival. As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of PFM18AAP would elucidate this enzyme's role in the P. falciparum lifecycle, and serve as potential therapeutic agents to control malaria infection.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Fluorescence-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum M18 Aspartyl Aminopeptidase (PFM18AAP)"" (AID 1822). In this biochemical assay, a commercially available fluorogenic peptide substrate (Z-Leu-Arg-MCA) is incubated with purified recombinant cathepsin L1 protein in the presence of test compounds. Cleavage of the substrate by cathepsin L1 releases the fluorogenic MCA leaving group, leading to an increase in well fluorescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit cathepsin L1 will prevent substrate cleavage and liberation of the fluorescent leaving group, resulting in decreased well fluorescence. Test compounds were assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of assay buffer (25mM Tris HCl pH7.5, 1mM DTT, 0.1% BSA) containing 1.5micrograms/mL cathepsin L were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO, Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (1micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.  The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 100 micromolar Z-Leu-Arg-MCA substrate in buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1mM DTT) into all wells. Well fluorescence was read immediately (T0) on the Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer) and again after 90 minutes (T90) of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius.  Prior to further calculations, T0 was subtracted from T90 for each individual well. The difference between RFU values read at T0 (RFU_T0) and T90 (RFU_T90), named delta RFU, was calculated as follows:  delta RFU = RFU_T90 - RFU_T0  The percent inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  Percent inhibition = ( test_compound_delta RFU - negative_control_delta RFU ) / ( positive_control_delta RFU - negative_control_delta RFU ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds. Positive_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-14, for inactive 14-0.

The U2OS-HRE-luc cell line was originally obtained from Dr. Margaret Ashcroft's lab and kindly provided by Dr. Shawn Gilbert.   The U2OS-HRE-luc cell line is propagated in DMEM media (Invitrogen, SKU11995) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016) and 0.1 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, 10687-01) at 37c in CO2 incubators (Thermo Scientific) with 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity. For High-Throughput Screening assays, cells are grown in T175 flask (BD Falcon, Ref 353112) or Hyperflasks (Corning, Cat 10010), harvested at more than 80% confluence using 7 or 75 ml Trypsin-EDTA 0.25% (Cellgro, Cat. No. 25-053-CI) for 5 minutes and then the trypsin is inactivated with 7 or 75 ml of complete medium respectively. Cells should not be trypsinized more than 10 minutes because massive cell death will start to occur. Cells are centrifuged at 1000rpm/5min and resuspended in fresh complete DMEM media with phenol (Invitrogen, SKU11995) as mentioned above (for normal cell propagation) or DMEM medium without phenol (Cambrex; Cat. No 12-917F or Invitrogen; cat. no.31053) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen, 10378-016), sodium pyruvate (only used with DMEM without phenol from Invitrogen (cat 11306-070)) and without hygromycin B (for compound screening). Cell number is counted using a Nexelcom Bioscience cell counter (Cellometer(r) Auto M10) and viability is measured by mixing one volume of cells with one same volume of Trypan Blue solution (0.4%)(dilution 1/2). Only cultures of >94% viability are utilized for HTS.  Compound Screening is carried out on the Broad Institute/Chemical Biology Platform General system (GS) automation unit:  Day 1 (Cell plating): 1.  U2OS-HRE-luc cells are harvested and resuspended in DMEM without phenol (Cambrex, 12-917F) with 10% Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Cat. No. 16140089), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen,10378-016) without hygromycin B. U2OS HRE-luciferase cells (from an initial cell suspension of 120,000 cells/ml) are dispensed using a MultiDrop Combi/Standard tube dispensing cassette (Thermo Scientific) in white bottom 384 well assay plates (Corning, Cat.No. 8867BC) at a final density of 6,000 cells per well in final volume of 50 μL. The cells are kept in suspension using a magnetic bar and a stirrer during the dispensing.  2. The assay plate (cell plate) are placed in Liconic Instruments cassettes (22 plates/cassette) and  incubated for 24 hours at 37C in the Liconic CO2 incubator 9 (Model STX 220IC)(General automation system (GS)) (Liconic Instruments) calibrated at 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 95% humidity.  Day 2 (Compound pinning into assay plate): 3.The MLPCN test compounds plates are transferred from the Compound Management incubators STX10001 and 2 system (Liconic Instruments) on the GS to the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 (Model STX 220HR) before the initiation of the pinning run. The In-plate positive control compound plate (sentinel)(100 μM DFX (Desferrioxamine), Sigma-Aldrich D9533, BRD-K09821361-066-08-4), dose response plate (DFX) (12 different concentrations starting at 160 μM and diluted 2 fold on each subsequent well) or vehicle (Base plate, DMSO) are already present in the Liconic incubator 8 at the beginning of the pinning. Both STX and Liconic 8 CO2 incubator temperature are kept at 20C. First, the base plate and the dose response plate are pinned once using 384 well pin tool (100 nl) on pin table (GS) and transferred to assay plate. Pins are washed with methanol and DMSO between each pinning. Second, the MLPCN test compounds plates are pinned as well as the in-plate positive control (32 wells, 100 μM DFX) are pinned consecutively one after the other and transferred into one assay plate. Each compound plate is pinned twice in 2 different assay plates (duplicate).  The final concentration for the MLPCN test compounds is 7.5μM with final concentration no more than 1% DMSO. Finally, a second round of the base plate and the dose response plate pinning is achieved at the end of the run.  4.   After the pinning has occured, the In-plate positive control, dose response and base plates are returning into the Liconic CO2 incubator 8 and the MLPCN compounds plates are placed back into the STX1000 systems. The assay plates treated with compounds are moving back to Liconic CO2 incubator 9 to be incubated for an additional 24 hours.  Day 3 (Reading luminescence from assay plates with Envision): 5.The assay plates are physically transferred from Liconic CO2 incubator 9 to Liconic CO2 incubator 7 (Model STX 220IC). Each assay plate is pulled out of the incubator and cooled down at room temperature for 30 minutes on Liconic Caroussel 1. 30 μL/well (384 well) of Steady-Glo luciferase reagent 0.5X (diluted in H2O) (Promega, E2550) is dispensed using the the MultiDrop Combi/long tubing dispensing cassette from Thermo Scientific. The assay plate returned to Liconic Caroussel 1 for 30 minutes to allow a complete cellular lysis.  6.  Luminescence is measured (0.2 second/well) using the ultra sensitive luminescence detector (384-well aperture, 0.5 mm height) in each well using the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer)(Corning plate setting).  7.   HRE activation is calculated based on the following equation using mean luminescence (RLU) values:  Fold Activation = Treatment - Background No treatment - Background  Compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in both assay plates  will be considered as active hits. Compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) greater than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in only one out of 2 assay plates will be considered inconclusives and the compounds inducing a luminescent response (RLU) lower than 10% of the value obtained with in-plate positive (100 microM Desferrioxamine) added to the negative control (DMSO) background in both assay plates will be considered not actives. ","HTS Data Analysis:  Negative control:  DMSO only Positive control:  Desferrioxamine, 100 micromolar Threshold activity cutoff: 10% (this value is between 4-5 standard deviations of the negative control).   Negative control wells (n=32) and positive controls well (n=32) were included on every plate.  The PubChem_Activity_Score was derived using the follow procedure: 1. A background-subtracted value was calculated for each well by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells on each plate from the value of each well on that plate.  1. A normalized value for each well was derived using Genedata Screener Assay Analyzer (v6.0.1).  The value of each well was normalized using the ""Stimulators Minus Neutral Contols"" method.  When using this method, a background-subtracted value is derived by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells on each plate from the value of each well on that plate.  This background-subtracted value is then divided by the median of the positive controls on the plate and multiplied by 100 to derive the normalized value.   2. Systematic plate effects were then corrected for each run by using the ""Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)"" correction method of Genedata Screener Assay Analyzer (v.6.0.1).  This final PubChem_Activity_Score per compound represents the mean of all valid replicate activity scores.  The PubChem_Activity_Outcome class was assigned as described below:  Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive) PubChem_Activity_Score <10, and less than half of all replicates have PubChem_Activity_Score >=10  Activity_Outcome = 2 (active) PubChem_Activity_Score >=10 and at least half of all replicates have PubChem_Activity_Score >=10  Activity_Outcome = 3 (inconclusive) PubChem_Activity_Score <10, but at least half of all replicates have PubChem_Activity_Score >=10.     or PubChem_Activity_Score >=10 and less than half of all replicates have PubChem_Activity_Score >=10",,,,,Luminescence Cell-Based Primary HTS to Identify Transcriptional Activators of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor Pathway,Broad Institute,2030-01-ACTIVATORS-SINGLE_POINT-MLPCN_HTS,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2009-08-26,,300409,950,299207,300341,950,299139,1.2,Live,,,,cell-based format,reporter-gene assay,bioluminescence

Description:  The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the activity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication. Hypophosphorylated RB inhibits cell cycle progression by sequestering E2F, thus preventing the activation of genes required for S phase transition. Due to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB activity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding protein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2, 3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold which belongs to the DUF1234 domain superfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported, this protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that it is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was recently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad (4).  A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation came from studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA expression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3). RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3), and RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition through its interaction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in gender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6). As a result, the identification of compounds that selectively inhibit RBBP9 activity may provide valuable probes for the study of apoptosis, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis.  References:  1.

This assay also serves as a primary counterscreen for a previous set of experiments entitled, ""Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)"" (AID 1515). In this biochemical assay, recombinant Fam108B protein is incubated with test compounds and FP-Rh probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as Fam 108B inhibitors will prevent Fam 108B-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.51 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 0.625 micromolar of Fam108B protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Catalytically dead Fam108B (S170A) protein (0.625 micromolar) in Assay Buffer was dispensed to positive control wells. Next, 48 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.0.951% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as the median value of all test compound wells. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Fam 108B in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing catalytically dead Fam 108B (S170A) protein in the presence of DMSO.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-11, for inactive 11-0.

Description:  During each cell cycle in eukaryotes, the genome must be completely replicated and this replication must begin at the correct time and site (initiation site or origin) (1). Pathogenic viruses often take advantage of this cellular precision to maintain replication of their own genome. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an orally-transmitted herpesvirus associated with numerous human neoplasms (2) that infects over 90% of the world's population (3). Latent EBV infection stimulates B cell proliferation in vitro, and can lead to B cell transformation (4). Following infection, the EBV genome is maintained in the host cell as a plasmid that is replicated by machinery comprised of several host proteins and a sole EBV protein, the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1). This EBNA-1 protein is required for replication of the EBV DNA genome. EBNA-1 is a DNA-binding protein that binds to an EBV sequence called the viral origin of replication plasmid, OriP (5). Studies demonstrating a role for EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease (6), multiple sclerosis (7), lupus (8), infectious mononucleosis (9), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (10), combined with the recent discovery that EBNA-1 induces DNA double strand breaks (11), suggest that inhibitors of EBNA-1 may serve useful for understanding virus-cell interactions, virus-mediated cellular transformation, and as therapies for EBV-associated pathologies.

Description:  The process of transcription converts the DNA sequences found in genes into mRNA (1, 2). This process is coupled to the subsequent removal of mRNA introns by splicing, which additionally serves to increase proteome complexity (3, 4). Intron splicing also occurs for transfer RNA (tRNA), which functions in the delivery of amino acids to the growing peptide chain as directed by the associated triplet codon during translation (5). This essential splicing step removes an intron in the anticodon loop, and occurs in organisms from Archaea to Eukarya (3, 6, 7). In yeast the final pre-tRNA splicing step is catalyzed by 2'-phosphotransferase 1 (Tpt1) (8-10), which transfers the 2'-phosphate from pre-tRNA to NAD to produce the mature tRNA (5, 7, 8). Although early studies suggested that Tpt1 was essential for yeast and humans (6), a recent report showing that null mice mutants of Trpt1 [the mammalian homologue of Tpt1 (11)] are normal and fertile, with no detectable defects in tRNA splicing or non-conventional splicing, suggests that the gene is dispensable in mammals (12). As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of Tpt1 may prove useful in the elucidation of the specific splicing function of this enzyme in diverse organisms and as potential anti-fungal agents.

In this biochemical assay, recombinant TPT1p, NAD+, and substrate comprised of a G-2'PO4(2+) moiety (U6GP) tagged 5' with biotin and 3' with Alexa-fluor-488 (B-U6GP-AF) are incubated in the presence of test compounds (13). During the reaction, TPT1 dephosphorylates B-U6GP-AF, generating a cleavable substrate for RNase T1, followed by uncoupling of the fluorescent and biotin tags. Under these conditions, the fluorescence polarization value of the well is low. As designed, compounds that inhibit TPT1 will prevent TPT1-mediated substrate dephosphorylation and cleavage by RNAse T1, thereby preventing the uncoupling of the tags, leading to high well fluorescence polarization values.

Description:  The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein controls cell cycle progression by regulating the activity of the transcription factor E2F (1), which activates genes essential for DNA replication. Hypophosphorylated RB inhibits cell cycle progression by sequestering E2F, thus preventing the activation of genes required for S phase transition. Due to the critical role of RB in regulating the cell cycle, factors that bind and regulate RB activity are considered valuable targets for preventing tumorigenesis. One such protein, RB binding protein 9 (RBBP9), is widely expressed in different tissues and upregulated in certain tumors (2, 3). The RBBP9 protein contains an alpha/beta hydrolase fold which belongs to the DUF1234 domain superfamily of unknown function. Although an enzymatic activity of RBBP9 has not been reported, this protein does react with activity-based probes that target serine hydrolases, suggesting that it is a functional enzyme. Also consistent with this premise, the crystal structure of RBBP9 was recently solved and revealed a well-structured active site with a properly arranged catalytic triad (4).  A role for RBBP9 in cellular transformation came from studies showing that RBBP9 mRNA expression is increased in transformed rat liver cell lines and human liver tumor biopsies (3). RBBP9-overexpressing cells form tumors when implanted into immuno-deficient mice (3), and RBBP9 overexpression confers resistance to TGF-ϐ1-induced growth inhibition through its interaction with Rb and displacement of E2F (3, 5). RBBP9 is also suggested to play a role in gender-related differential responses to radiation-induced cell proliferation (6).

This assay also serves as a counterscreen to identify thiol-reactive compounds identified as active in a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Retinoblastoma binding protein 9 (RBBP9)"" (AID 1515). In this assay, recombinant GSTO1 protein is incubated with test compounds and a Rh-conjugated sulfonate ester (SE) activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as GSTO1 inhibitors will prevent GSTO1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 1.25 micromolar of GSTO1-1 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM PS-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Prior to reading, plates were equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular) on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing GSTO1-1 in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no GSTO1-1 enzyme.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-17, for inactive 17-0.

Description:  Numerous essential biological processes, including transcription and mitosis require the kinase-mediated phosphorylation of target proteins at serine and threonine residues, which leads to activation, inactivation, degradation, or subcellular relocalization of the specific target. The actions of these kinases are opposed by the serine/threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs). Although much is known about serine/threonine kinases, less data are available on the PPPs (1). One such PPP is protein phosphate 5 (PP5), a lipid-activated (1) enzyme with recently identified roles in hormone- and stress-induced signaling networks (2). Because purified full-length PP5 (499 residues) has low basal activity (3), it is believed that the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of PP5 depends upon formation of complexes with protein partners. Studies showing that PP5 is a negative regulator of Raf-1 (4), forms heterocomplexes with the glucocorticoid receptor and the chaperone Hsp90 (5), and that treatment of cells with PP5 antisense oligonucleotides leads to G1 growth arrest (6), suggest that PP5 plays a role in cellular proliferation and stress-induced signaling pathways. The complete substrate profile of PP5 remains unknown. As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of PP5 activity may be useful for elucidating PP5 action in normal and cancerous cells, identifying PP5 binding partners, and for discovery of potential therapeutic agents for human cancers.

This biochemical, fluorescence-based assay employs purified PP5c (catalytic domain) and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) as the substrate. Cleavage of OMFP by PP5c converts OMFP to the product O-methylfluorescein that fluoresces when measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 540 nm. As designed, compounds that act as PP5 inhibitors will block PP5c catalytic activity, leading to reduced cleavage of OMFP, thereby reducing production of O-methylfluorescein and well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.7 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 3 microliters of assay buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH7.0; 0.13 mg/ml BSA; 0.013% Triton-X100; 1.3 mM DTT; 1.3 mM sodium ascorbate; 0.13 mM manganese chloride) containing 310pM PP5c were dispensed into each well of a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 27 nL of test compound in DMSO, PP5 inhibitor (100 micromolar final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.7 % final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The assay was started by dispensing 1 microliter of OMFP (200 micromolar in 3 mM HCl) to each well. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 2 microliters of 300 mM potassium phosphate dibasic at pH 10.0 were added to each well to terminate the assay.  Well fluorescence was read on a PerkinElmer Viewlux using fluorescein filters: excitation wavelength of 480 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 540 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth).  The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  % Inhibition = ( RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing PP5 inhibitor. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.

TOR functions in two distinct protein complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 [Cafferkey, et al. 1993; Stan, et al. 1994]. Curiously, only TOR in TORC1 is bound and inhibited by the lipophilic macrolide rapamycin [Kunz, et al. 1993; Helliwell, et al. 1998; Zhang, et al. 2006]. Although the signaling events up- and downstream of TORC2 (which regulates spatial aspects of growth) have yet to be elucidated in detail, it is well established that TORC1 is a central hub of a signaling network that couples cues from hormones and growth factors (in mammalian cells), energy and stresses, and the abundance of nutrients, to cell growth and proliferation. Very recent work has elucidated many details of the signaling events upstream of TORC1 as well as downstream targets of TORC1. Importantly, in this context, most negative regulators of mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1)have been previously identified as tumor suppressor gene products, while many positive regulators of mTORC1 have been identified as proto-oncoproteins and/or are found at elevated levels in tumor-derived cell lines [De Virgilio, et al. 2006a; De Virgilio, et al. 2006b].  The purpose of this HTS screen is to identify small molecule modulators of protein targets in the pathway containing the target of rapamycin (TOR), a multi-protein complex (TORC1 and TORC2) that is highly conserved from yeast to man.  The screen will detect structurally distinct, but functionally rapamycin-like compounds (rapalogs) by probing four major TOR pathways using the following targets in a multiplex format:  RPL 19A:  YAK kinase branch LAP4:  MSN4 branch MEP2 and AGP1:  GLN3 branch CIT2:  RTG branch  Each of these target proteins (RPL 19A, LAP4, MEP2, AGP1, CIT2) are GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) tagged, thus the expression of the proteins can be tracked by monitoring the GFP fluorescence. This report specifically addresses the MEP2 target in the GLN3 branch of the TOR pathway. ","The yeast cell-based multiplex assay is constructed using 5 strains from the Yeast-GFP Collection (Invitrogen, USA), representing 4 distinct branches of the TOR pathway:  YAK Kinase, MSN4, GLN3 and RTG. Differential stain barcoding is used to discriminate between yeast strains in the multiplex using ratiometric labeling with Alexafluor 405 (violet laser excitation) and Alexafluor 633 (red laser excitation).  Bar-coded yeast cell populations are discriminated then interrogated for changes in GFP expression (blue laser excitation).  The assay is performed in a total volume of 10.1 microliters in 384-well microtiter plates. The strains are grown separately overnight in synthetic complete liquid media in a shaking incubator at 30 degrees C, and then stained for multiplexing with the violet and red alexafluors. Following staining, the yeast are combined and diluted into fresh media at 0.2 OD600. Aliquots of the multiplex are transferred into 384-well microtiter plates and library compounds are added at 10microM final concentration. The cells are incubated at for 3 hours at 30 degrees C with end-over-end rotation. Control wells contain the multiplex treated for 3 hours with 200nanogram/milliliter Rapamycin as a positive control and the multiplex is treated with an equal volume of DMSO as a solvent control. The cells in the multiplex are interrogated for GFP expression levels using established high-throughput flow cytometric methodologies at the UNMCMD.  Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) (Intellicyt, USA) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates [Kuckuck, et al. 2001]. Flow cytometric data are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako, USA).   Data analysis of the original flow cytometric data was done using HyperView (R) (Intellicyt, USA) software.  The data are gated on forward scatter versus side scatter to distinguish the single yeast population.  Additional gating are made to separate the different stained yeast strains.  These gates are made on graphs of FL8 versus FL6 data (i.e., red versus violet laser excitation).  HyperView applies these different gates and parses the time-resolved data file to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well, which are merges with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip(R) (Intellicyt, USA) software. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel (R) (Microsoft, USA) template file constructed specifically for the assay to calculate the percent response and segregate data for each target.  Calculations:   Percent Response is calculated in comparison to negative control (wells with DMSO) using the following equation: %Response = 100*RawMCF_Sample/PlateAve_RawMCF_NCntrl where RawMCF_Sample is the median channel fluorescence measured from the well with sample compound and PlateAve_RawMCF_NCntrl is the average of the median channel fluorescence measured from all the negative control wells on the plate.  Note, in order to eliminate effects of potential spillover from innate fluorescent compounds into the control wells, the plate average of the negative control wells are only of the control wells that are within 1 standard deviation of all 16 control wells on the plate.  Effects of innate fluorescence compounds resulted in shifting of yeast strains from their designated red versus violet.  Tracking of these compounds were made by assessing if there were missing strains for a particular compound, and annotated in column PUBCHEM_COMMENT.  For this upload of around 150,000 compounds there were around 2,700 fluorescent compounds.  Compounds were demeaned Active if the percent response was greater than 175, which corresponded closely to the average response plus 3 standard deviations of the entire screen, and for the MEP2 strain that was 100 + 3*24.3 = 173.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was calculated from the %Response: SCORE = %Response - 100 Thus any %Responses less than 100% were given SCORE values of 0.  An Active compound has a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 75.  If there were less than 70 events measured for on yeast strain, then the compound was listed as ""Inconclusive"".

TOR functions in two distinct protein complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 [Cafferkey, et al. 1993; Stan, et al. 1994]. Curiously, only TOR in TORC1 is bound and inhibited by the lipophilic macrolide rapamycin [Kunz, et al. 1993; Helliwell, et al. 1998; Zhang, et al. 2006]. Although the signaling events up- and downstream of TORC2 (which regulates spatial aspects of growth) have yet to be elucidated in detail, it is well established that TORC1 is a central hub of a signaling network that couples cues from hormones and growth factors (in mammalian cells), energy and stresses, and the abundance of nutrients, to cell growth and proliferation. Very recent work has elucidated many details of the signaling events upstream of TORC1 as well as downstream targets of TORC1. Importantly, in this context, most negative regulators of mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1)have been previously identified as tumor suppressor gene products, while many positive regulators of mTORC1 have been identified as proto-oncoproteins and/or are found at elevated levels in tumor-derived cell lines [De Virgilio, et al. 2006a; De Virgilio, et al. 2006b].  The purpose of this HTS screen is to identify small molecule modulators of protein targets in the pathway containing the target of rapamycin (TOR), a multi-protein complex (TORC1 and TORC2) that is highly conserved from yeast to man.  The screen will detect structurally distinct, but functionally rapamycin-like compounds (rapalogs) by probing four major TOR pathways using the following targets in a multiplex format:  RPL 19A:  YAK kinase branch LAP4:  MSN4 branch MEP2 and AGP1:  GLN3 branch CIT2:  RTG branch  Each of these target proteins (RPL 19A, LAP4, MEP2, AGP1, CIT2) are GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) tagged, thus the expression of the proteins can be tracked by monitoring the GFP fluorescence. This report specifically addresses the RPL 19A target in the YAK Kinase branch of the TOR pathway. ","The yeast cell-based multiplex assay is constructed using 5 strains from the Yeast-GFP Collection (Invitrogen, USA), representing 4 distinct branches of the TOR pathway:  YAK Kinase, MSN4, GLN3 and RTG. Differential stain barcoding is used to discriminate between yeast strains in the multiplex using ratiometric labeling with Alexafluor 405 (violet laser excitation) and Alexafluor 633 (red laser excitation).  Bar-coded yeast cell populations are discriminated then interrogated for changes in GFP expression (blue laser excitation).  The assay is performed in a total volume of 10.1 microliters in 384-well microtiter plates. The strains are grown separately overnight in synthetic complete liquid media in a shaking incubator at 30 degrees C, and then stained for multiplexing with the violet and red alexafluors. Following staining, the yeast are combined and diluted into fresh media at 0.2 OD600. Aliquots of the multiplex are transferred into 384-well microtiter plates and library compounds are added at 10microM final concentration. The cells are incubated at for 3 hours at 30 degrees C with end-over-end rotation. Control wells contain the multiplex treated for 3 hours with 200nanogram/milliliter Rapamycin as a positive control and the multiplex is treated with an equal volume of DMSO as a solvent control. The cells in the multiplex are interrogated for GFP expression levels using established high-throughput flow cytometric methodologies at the UNMCMD.  Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) (Intellicyt, USA) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates [Kuckuck, et al. 2001]. Flow cytometric data are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako, USA).   Data analysis of the original flow cytometric data was done using HyperView (R) (Intellicyt, USA) software.  The data are gated on forward scatter versus side scatter to distinguish the single yeast population.  Additional gating are made to separate the different stained yeast strains.  These gates are made on graphs of FL8 versus FL6 data (i.e., red versus violet laser excitation).  HyperView applies these different gates and parses the time-resolved data file to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well, which are merges with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip(R) (Intellicyt, USA) software. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel (R) (Microsoft, USA) template file constructed specifically for the assay to calculate the percent response and segregate data for each target.  Calculations:   Percent Response is calculated in comparison to negative control (wells with DMSO) using the following equation: %Response = 100*RawMCF_Sample/PlateAve_RawMCF_NCntrl where RawMCF_Sample is the median channel fluorescence measured from the well with sample compound and PlateAve_RawMCF_NCntrl is the average of the median channel fluorescence measured from all the negative control wells on the plate.  Note, in order to eliminate effects of potential spillover from innate fluorescent compounds into the control wells, the plate average of the negative control wells are only of the control wells that are within 1 standard deviation of all 16 control wells on the plate.  Effects of innate fluorescence compounds resulted in shifting of yeast strains from their designated red versus violet.  Tracking of these compounds were made by assessing if there were missing strains for a particular compound, and annotated in column #PUBCHEM_COMMENT#.  For this upload of around 150,000 compounds there were around 2,700 fluorescent compounds.  Compared with the other strains tested in this multiplex, RPL 19A is unique in that in the presence of rapamycin there is no increase in RPL 19A expression during the span of the experiment, while just DMSO treated cells would increase RPL 19A expression.  Thus compounds were demeaned Active on RPL 19A if the percent response was less than 50, which corresponded closely to the average response minus three standard deviations of the entire screen, and for the RPL 19A strain that was 100 - 3*22.3=33.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was calculated from the %Response: SCORE = 100-%Response  Thus any %Responses greater than 100% were given SCORE values of 0.  An Active compound has a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 50.  If there were less than 70 events measured for on yeast strain, then the compound was listed as ""Inconclusive"".

2052,"This bioassay record (AID 2052) belongs to the assay project ""Summary report of screening for developing T Cell Immune Modulators"", which is associated with the summary AID 2087 and a total of 8 additional BioAssay records in PubChem.","University of New Mexico Assay Overview Assay Support:  1 X01 MH085707-01    Project Title:  HTS for developing T Cell Immune Modulators   PI:  Inkyu Hwang,PhD The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla)  Assay Implementation:  Mark K. Haynes PhD, Chelin Hu MS, Anna Waller PhD, Mark Carter MS University of New Mexico Center for Molecular Discovery  PI: Larry Sklar PhD  Assay Background and Significance: When naive T cells encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) displaying cognate MHC-peptide complexes (pMHCs), the T cell and the APC form a highly organized structure at the contact site termed the 'immunological synapse', which is critical not only for prolonged and stable T/APC contact but also for the efficient and organized T cell signaling required for cell cycle progression and development of effector functions. Several membrane proteins and their ligand partners are involved in the formation and stability of the immunological synapse, including the pMHC/TCR complex, as well as LFA-1/ICAM-1 and the secondary signaling pair B7/CD28. This assay takes advantage of the processes leading to the formation of the immunological synapse to probe for small molecules that interfere with its formation. High affinity LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions are central to sustained synapse formation [Reichardt, et al., 2007]. The LFA-1 molecule is a T cell integrin that plays unique and diverse roles in T cell immunity acting as both an adhesion and signaling molecule during cognate recognition of APC displayed pMHC by T cells [Smith, et al., 2007].  Integrins (including LFA-1) are highly regulated during immune responses, and ligands for integrins, such as ICAM-1 for LFA-1, are expressed on a wide variety of cell types and tissues.  The adhesive activity of LFA-1 requires high-affinity binding and it is well established that the functional activity of LFA-1 is profoundly increased by molecular signals triggered by other receptors (eg TCR/CD3 complex, chemokine receptors, CD28) or chemical compounds such as phorbol esters [Wojcikiewicz, et al. 2003]. The signaling process controlling LFA-1 function has been termed 'inside-out' signaling (intracellular signals generated by other receptor/ligand interactions prompt LFA-1 to alter its molecular properties). Several signaling molecules are known to be involved in the process, including adaptor proteins [Kim, et al., 2003] (eg ADAP24, VASP, and SLP-76) and small GTP-binding proteins25 (eg Rap 1). The actin cytoskeleton also plays a critical role in 'inside-out' signaling.    The important role of LFA-1 in T cell immunity makes it an attractive target for developing drugs and probes for treatment and understanding of inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, allergy, and organ transplantation. Moreover, over-expression of ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in tissues that experience chronic inflammation implicates LFA-1/ICAM-1 involvement in the initiation and/or progression of certain diseases [Rychly and Nebe, 2006]. Extensive efforts have been made to develop reagents that block the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction [Anderson and Siahaan, 2003]. The reagents developed include humanized monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind to LFA-1 or ICAM-1 and the cyclic peptides that bind to the LFA-128,30 epitope. Despite the reported effectiveness of these reagents in blocking the LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction, their clinical use has been limited [Li, et al. 2009].  The purpose of this screening campaign is to find small chemical compounds that modulate the LFA-1 / ICAM-1 interaction. The assay detects the interaction of fluorescently labeled vesicles with murine CD8+ T lymphocytes resulting from associations between the TCR complex/CD28/LFA-1 (T cells) and the MHC Class I + QL9 peptide complex/B7-1/ICAM-1 (vesicles).  Small molecules of interest could act as inhibitors of the extracellular molecular interactions. Alternatively, inhibitory compounds could cause changes in the T cell-vesicle interaction by acting via intracellular signaling pathways that are known to influence the T cell surface TCR complex assembly and the LFA-1 activation state. ","This is a flow cytometry, cell-based assay using freshly isolated T cells from 2C TCR transgenic mice. Direct stimulation of naive, transgenic murine CD8+ T cells is achieved using membrane micro-vesicles produced from transgenically-engineered drosophila cells expressing murine membrane proteins involved in naive T cell activation. It has been determined that ICAM-1/LFA-1 recognition as well as TCR/QL9 recognition are essential for stable binding of micro-vesicles to naive CD8+ T cells [Kovar et al., 2006; Hwang et al. 2003].  The assay is conducted in a 384-well microplate format. Drosophila micro-vesicles expressing B7-1 (the ligand partner for T cell-expressed CD28), ICAM-1 (the ligand partner for T cell expressed LFA-1) and the Ld class I murine MHC molecule, are incubated with the antigenic peptide, QL9 (QLSPFPFDL, single letter amino acid sequence), that binds to Ld and is specifically recognized by 2C TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells. QL9-loaded micro-vesicles are incubated (1.5 hour/37degrees C) with MACS-purified CD8+ T cells, followed by anti-CD8 (Alexa647) and anti-B7-1 (PE) staining (20 minutes on ice). The stained, CD8+ T cell/micro-vesicle mixture is fixed by the addition of paraformaldehyde (1%/10minutes), diluted with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry using the HyperCyt (Intellicyt, USA) high-throughput analytical platform.  Negative control wells on the plate contain micro-vesicles that are not loaded with QL9 antigenic peptide (naked micro-vesicles), resulting in low binding of micro-vesicles to CD8+ T cells. Positive control wells on the plate contain QL9 loaded vesicles and compound vehicle (0.7% DMSO).  Calculations:  The flow cytometric data are analyzed by HyperView(R) (IntelliCyt, USA) software and are initially gated on forward and side scatter parameters to distinguish the cell population from debris. Additional quadrant gating is made by placing calculation markers on FL2 (parameter used to measure PE conjugated anti-B7.1) versus FL8 (parameter used to measure APC conjugated anti-CD8-APC).  This distinguishes CD8+ T cells from CD8- cells (FL8) and high vesicle binding from low vesicle binding (FL2). The distinction of CD8+ versus CD8- is made during the initial analysis. The distinction between high and low vesicle binding is calculated based on pooling the negative control wells on a given plate and allowing for 10 percent of the CD8+ T cells to be in the double positive quadrant (i.e. the negative control population is defined as a population where 10% of the CD8+ T cells have bound naked micro-vesicles). Based on these gates, HyperView parses the temporal event clusters of the entire data file and produces an annotated fluorescence summary for each well. These data sets are merged with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip(R) (IntelliCyt, USA) software. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel (R) (Microsoft, USA) template file constructed specifically for this assay to calculate the percent response.  Out of the various parameters collected and calculated from the flow cytometric data, we focused on three: FL2 mean channel fluorescence of the CD8+ T cell population, percent events present in the double positive quadrant (CD8+ and vesicle binding+), and the 90th percentile FL2 fluorescence intensity for the CD8+ population. Due to variations over the plate, the percent response was calculated on a per-row-basis with the measurement of the positive control sample of a particular row being 100%, as per the following equation: %Response = 100* Sample_CD8+_Mean/Row_PCntr_CD8+_Mean where Sample_CD8+_Mean is the FL2 mean channel fluorescence of the CD8+ T cells in the test sample well and Row_PCntr_CD8+_Mean is the FL2 mean channel fluorescence of CD8+ T cells from the positive control well in the same row as the sample well. Note the use of mean channel fluorescence values rather than median. With this method of calculating a response, a compound that blocks vesicle binding to CD8+ T cells would result in a %Response less than 100%.  The other two parameters were used as calculated from HyperView.  Compounds were considered  Active if they exhibited values outside 1 standard deviation for all three of the assessed parameters.  Thus compounds were identified as active if the %Response < 81, %Events in the double positive quadrant (CD8+ and vesicle binding+ population) < 18, and CD8+ 90th PFI < 36.    The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was calculated from a weighted function of these three parameters and given to any Active compound: SCORE = 0.4*(100 - %Response) + 0.4 *(100 - %Events) + 20*(36 - 90th PFI)/36 where %Response is calculated based on FL2 mean channel fluorescence of the CD8+ T cell population, %Events are the percentage of events the double positive quadrant (CD8+ and vesicle binding+ population), and 90th PFI is the 90th percentile fluorescence intensity for the CD8+ population.

Description:  Cancer initialization and survival depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) machinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although an effective mechanism for anti-cancer chemotherapeutics is apoptosis induction, cancer cells develop resistance to the pro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). Multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) are two well-characterized lymphoid cancers (3). Bcl-2 is an oncoprotein activated in these lymphomas, and serves to inhibit apoptosis induced by many cytotoxic compounds. Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are regulated by protein-protein interactions, forming homo- and heterodimers (4, 5). One of these proteins, MCL1, is essential for survival of human MM cells (6). MCL1 and other Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xl share Bcl-2's ability to oppose apoptosis, as well as sequence homology in 4 α-helical Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1-BH4 (3). As a result, these proteins are promising targets for studies on tumor initiation, progression and apoptosis resistance. Research showing that MCL1 opposes cell death (7), is highly expressed in hematopoetic stem cells and is regulated by growth factors (8), and that inhibiting Bcl-2 protein-protein interactions via the crucial BH3 domain is a valid approach to cancer drug development (2, 9, 10), suggest that targeted therapies for MCL1 are needed. The identification of selective inhibitors of MCL1 will provide useful tools for the study of lymphoid tumorigenesis, and elucidate mechanisms for apoptosis induction in resistant cancers.

Binding of peptide to MCL1 target protein increases the effective molecular mass of the peptide, slowing its rotation and increasing millipolarization (mP) units in the well. As designed, compounds that inhibit MCL1 will prevent binding of Bim peptide to MCL1, and increase the proportion of free to bound peptides, thereby reducing mP in the well. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 10.9 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) containing 9.2 nM GST-MCL1 were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, unlabeled Bim-BH3 control peptide (0.770 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.45% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells.  The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 8.0 nanomolar FITC-BH3-Bim peptide in assay buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) into all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 595nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  Percent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) / ( median_ Positive_Control_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing unlabeled Bim-BH3 peptide.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-7, for inactive 7-0.

TOR functions in two distinct protein complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 [Cafferkey, et al. 1993; Stan, et al. 1994]. Curiously, only TOR in TORC1 is bound and inhibited by the lipophilic macrolide rapamycin [Kunz, et al. 1993; Helliwell, et al. 1998; Zhang, et al. 2006]. Although the signaling events up- and downstream of TORC2 (which regulates spatial aspects of growth) have yet to be elucidated in detail, it is well established that TORC1 is a central hub of a signaling network that couples cues from hormones and growth factors (in mammalian cells), energy and stresses, and the abundance of nutrients, to cell growth and proliferation. Very recent work has elucidated many details of the signaling events upstream of TORC1 as well as downstream targets of TORC1. Importantly, in this context, most negative regulators of mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1)have been previously identified as tumor suppressor gene products, while many positive regulators of mTORC1 have been identified as proto-oncoproteins and/or are found at elevated levels in tumor-derived cell lines [De Virgilio, et al. 2006a; De Virgilio, et al. 2006b].  The purpose of this HTS screen is to identify small molecule modulators of protein targets in the pathway containing the target of rapamycin (TOR), a multi-protein complex (TORC1 and TORC2) that is highly conserved from yeast to man.  The screen will detect structurally distinct, but functionally rapamycin-like compounds (rapalogs) by probing four major TOR pathways using the following targets in a multiplex format:  RPL 19A:  YAK kinase branch LAP4:  MSN4 branch MEP2 and AGP1:  GLN3 branch CIT2:  RTG branch  Each of these target proteins (RPL 19A, LAP4, MEP2, AGP1, CIT2) are GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) tagged, thus the expression of the proteins can be tracked by monitoring the GFP fluorescence. This report specifically addresses the AGP1 target in the GLN3 branch of the TOR pathway. ","The yeast cell-based multiplex assay is constructed using 5 strains from the Yeast-GFP Collection (Invitrogen, USA), representing 4 distinct branches of the TOR pathway:  YAK Kinase, MSN4, GLN3 and RTG. Differential stain barcoding is used to discriminate between yeast strains in the multiplex using ratiometric labeling with Alexafluor 405 (violet laser excitation) and Alexafluor 633 (red laser excitation).  Bar-coded yeast cell populations are discriminated then interrogated for changes in GFP expression (blue laser excitation).  The assay is performed in a total volume of 10.1 microliters in 384-well microtiter plates. The strains are grown separately overnight in synthetic complete liquid media in a shaking incubator at 30 degrees C, and then stained for multiplexing with the violet and red alexafluors. Following staining, the yeast are combined and diluted into fresh media at 0.2 OD600. Aliquots of the multiplex are transferred into 384-well microtiter plates and library compounds are added at 10microM final concentration. The cells are incubated at for 3 hours at 30 degrees C with end-over-end rotation. Control wells contain the multiplex treated for 3 hours with 200nanogram/milliliter Rapamycin as a positive control and the multiplex is treated with an equal volume of DMSO as a solvent control. The cells in the multiplex are interrogated for GFP expression levels using established high-throughput flow cytometric methodologies at the UNMCMD.  Sample analysis is conducted with the HyperCyt(R) (Intellicyt, USA) high throughput flow cytometry platform.  The HyperCyt system interfaces a flow cytometer and autosampler for high-throughput microliter-volume sampling from 384-well microtiter plates [Kuckuck, et al. 2001]. Flow cytometric data are collected on a Cyan Flow Cytometer (Dako, USA).   Data analysis of the original flow cytometric data was done using HyperView (R) (Intellicyt, USA) software.  The data are gated on forward scatter versus side scatter to distinguish the single yeast population.  Additional gating are made to separate the different stained yeast strains.  These gates are made on graphs of FL8 versus FL6 data (i.e., red versus violet laser excitation).  HyperView applies these different gates and parses the time-resolved data file to produce annotated fluorescence summary data for each well, which are merges with compound worklist files generated by HyperSip(R) (Intellicyt, USA) software. The parsed data are then processed through an Excel (R) (Microsoft, USA) template file constructed specifically for the assay to calculate the percent response and segregate data for each target.  Calculations:   Percent Response is calculated in comparison to negative control (wells with DMSO) using the following equation: %Response = 100*RawMCF_Sample/PlateAve_RawMCF_NCntrl where RawMCF_Sample is the median channel fluorescence measured from the well with sample compound and PlateAve_RawMCF_NCntrl is the average of the median channel fluorescence measured from all the negative control wells on the plate.  Note, in order to eliminate effects of potential spillover from innate fluorescent compounds into the control wells, the plate average of the negative control wells are only of the control wells that are within 1 standard deviation of all 16 control wells on the plate.  Effects of innate fluorescence compounds resulted in shifting of yeast strains from their designated red versus violet.  Tracking of these compounds were made by assessing if there were missing strains for a particular compound, and annotated in column PUBCHEM_COMMENT.  For this upload of around 150,000 compounds there were around 2,700 fluorescent compounds.  Compounds were demeaned Active if the percent response was greater than 150, which corresponded closely to the average response plus 3 standard deviations of the entire screen, and for the AGP1 strain that was 100 + 3*13.6 = 141.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was calculated from the %Response: SCORE = %Response - 100 Thus any %Responses less than 100% were given SCORE values of 0.  An Active compound has a PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE greater than 50.  If there were less than 70 events measured for on yeast strain, then the compound was listed as ""Inconclusive"".    Zprime was calculated from the average and standard deviations of the rapamycin control and DMSO control.

Robert Gould, Broad Institute, rgould@broadinstitute.org, Cambridge, MA.  Project Overview:  The goal of this project is to identify inhibitors of the histone demethylase GASC-1 (gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma-1).  GASC-1 has roles in cancer, androgen receptor signaling and the maintenance of pluripotency. GASC-1 directly and specifically removes repressive histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation in an iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent hydroxylation mechanism.  Probes that inhibit GASC-1 activity in a DELFIA primary assay will be tested for specificity in counter screens to determine if their mechanism of activity is specific to GASC-1 alone, to all JMJ demethylases, to JMJ demethylases and non-JMJ demethylases, or to hydroxylases in general.  Following classification into one of the previous selectivity classes, lead compounds from each group will be tested in a cell-based secondary assay for GASC-1 inhibitory activity. Finally, probe candidates will be tested in a cell-based counter screen to determine if their cell-based activity is specific to GASC-1.    Assay Overview: Compounds were assayed for inhibitory activity against the gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma-1 (GASC-1) histone demethylase using a dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay (DELFIA). Compounds that cause a reduction in GASC-1 demethylase activity will be further tested for target specificity. Assays were conducted in 384-well neutravidin coated DELFIA plates (Perkin Elmer, CC11-H10), using recombinant GASC-1 (GST-JMJD2C 1-420). Compounds were pinned (25 nL, 2.35 uM final concentration) into 20 uL GASC-1 enzyme mix immediately before addition of 20 uL of 2X trimethyl jmjC peptide/cofactor mix.  This mixture was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h, while GASC-1 could carry out the demethylation reaction and the peptide substrate could attach to the plate surface. Following incubation, plates were washed three times with 100 uL wash buffer. Following washing and aspiration, 50 uL of antibody mix was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature.  The antibody mix contained both a monoclonal antibody specific to the dimethyl peptide (anti-2x-di-H3K9 IgG (Abcam, ab32521)) and a secondary polyclonal europium labeled antibody specific to the primary (Eu-anti-rabbit (PerkinElmer, AD0106)). Plates were washed three times as before and 50 uL of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, 4001-0010) was then added and europium emission was measured after 60 min (ex. 360 nm, em. 620 nm).","Taken from 2043-01-A01-02  1. The positive control compound pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (Sigma, P63395) was added to each of the pre-assigned poscon wells of the 384-well neutravidin coated assay plate (Perkin Elmer, CC11-H10) using a Combi nL liquid dispenser (Thermo Scientific) at an off-line workstation. 2. Assay plates were then loaded into a room temperature Liconic incubator (STX 2201C) on an enclosed automated screening system (HiRes Biosolutions).  Each run was initiated and scheduled with the Cellario software (HiRes Biosolutions) and runs were tracked in CBIP (Broad Chemical Biology Informatics Platform).  Staubli arms moved plates from different instruments on the robotic system. 3. Assay plates were filled with 20 uL/well of GASC-1 enzyme mix (150 ng GST-JMJD2C (1-420) in 40 mM TRIS pH 8.5, 8 mM glutathione) using a Multidrop Combi liquid dispenser.  Enzyme mix was kept on ice and warmed to room temperature using a 6 ft Combi tube draped in a room temperature water bath. 4. Assay plates were then pinned with 25 nL 3.75 mM compound (final concentration = 2.35 uM) each with a 25 nL pin head using a MicroPin pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions). 5.  Plates with compound then had 20 uL/well 2x jmjC peptide/cofactors (100 uM 2-oxogluterate, 10 uM iron sulfate, 0.5 uM peptide bio-H3(1-20)-cys-biotin) added using a second Multidrop Combi liquid dispenser and were incubated at room temperature 60 minutes. 6.  Plates were then washed 3x with 100 uL/well wash buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.05 % Tween 20) using a BioTek plate washer. 7.  Plates then had 50 uL/well antibody mix (anti-2x-di-H3K9 IgG (ab32521 lot 400724) (1:5000) and Eu-anti-rabbit (Wallac/PerkinElmer AD0106 batch 392-158-A) (1:1000) in 50 uL FI-buffer (50 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.05 % Tween 40, 25 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 0.2 % bovine serium albumin, 0.05 % bovine gamma globulins)) added using a thrid MultiDrop Combi and were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 8. Plates were then washed again in the same manner as in step 6. 9. Plates then had 50 uL/well enhancement solution (Wallac/PerkinElmer 4001-0010) added using a fourth MultiDrop Combi and were incubated at room temperature for 60 min. 10. Europium emission was then measure using a Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Excitation: 360 nm, Emission 620 nm, integration 400 ms). 11. Plates were then discarded.","HTS Data Analysis   Each assay plate was run in singlicate.  A small percentage of wells were run in replicates. 32 negative control wells (DMSO) were included on every plate. Active compounds were expected to result in decreased fluorescence signal.   For the purpose of normalization, a synthetic positive control value (active control, or AC) was generated for each plate which was equal to 0.3 time the median value of the DMSO neutral controls (NC) on the same plate.  Compound well signals were then scaled to these control values using the 'Neutral controls minus inhibitors' algorithm in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3), where (median of NC) >> 0, and (median of NC)(0.3) = AC >> -100.   A plate correction matrix was applied using the 'Runwise (Additive)' algorithm in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3)   The final PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was calculated by multiplying the mean of all valid replicate values (which can be described in units of negative percent activity) by -1, resulting in a score between 0 and 100 (in units of 'percent inhibition'). Since most wells were not tested in replicate, so the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE value was the same as the well value itself.   The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME class was assigned as described below, based on an activity threshold of -50%:       Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive)     0% of replicates fall outside threshold.       Activity_Outcome = 2 (active)     >50% of replicates fall outside threshold.       Activity_Outcome = 3 (inconclusive)     >0% and <= 50% of replicates fall outside threshold.

Description:  Cancer initialization and survival depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) machinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although an effective mechanism for anti-cancer chemotherapeutics is apoptosis induction, cancer cells develop resistance to the pro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). Multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) are two well-characterized lymphoid cancers (3). Bcl-2 is an oncoprotein activated in these lymphomas, and serves to inhibit apoptosis induced by many cytotoxic compounds. Members of the Bcl-2 protein family are regulated by protein-protein interactions, forming homo- and heterodimers (4, 5). One of these proteins, MCL1, is essential for survival of human MM cells (6). MCL1 and other Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xl share Bcl-2's ability to oppose apoptosis, as well as sequence homology in 4 α-helical Bcl-2 homology (BH) regions, BH1-BH4 (3). As a result, these proteins are promising targets for studies on tumor initiation, progression and apoptosis resistance. Research showing that MCL1 opposes cell death (7), is highly expressed in hematopoetic stem cells and is regulated by growth factors (8), and that inhibiting Bcl-2 protein-protein interactions via the crucial BH3 domain is a valid approach to cancer drug development (2, 9, 10), suggest that targeted therapies for MCL1 are needed. The identification of selective inhibitors of MCL1 will provide useful tools for the study of lymphoid tumorigenesis, and elucidate mechanisms for apoptosis induction in resistant cancers.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Fluorescence polarization primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1)"" (AID 2057) and confirms BH3 mimetic activity of compounds of interest. This fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay monitors binding of the BH3 domain of the Bcl-2 family member, Bim, to the binding pocket of Bcl-xL. GST-Bcl-xL fusion protein is incubated with FITC-BH3-Bim peptides, in the presence of test compounds. Binding of peptide to Bcl-xL target protein increases the effective molecular mass of the peptide, slowing its rotation and increasing millipolarization (mP) units in the well. As designed, compounds that inhibit Bcl-xL will prevent binding of peptide to Bcl-xL protein, and increase the ratio of free to bound peptides, thereby reducing mP in the well. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 10.9 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) containing 12.5 nM Bcl-XL were dispensed into a 1536 microtiter plate. Next, 55 nL of test compound in DMSO, unlabeled Bim-BH3 control peptide (0.770 micromolar final concentration), or DMSO alone (0.9% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells.  The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 microliters of 8.0 nanomolar FITC-BH3-Bim peptide in assay buffer (Dulbecco's PBS pH 7.2, Brij 35 0.001%) into all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 20 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 595nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  Percent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) / ( median_ Positive_Control_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing unlabeled Bim-BH3 peptide.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-8, for inactive 8-0.

Description:  Reversible protein phosphorylation networks play essential roles in most cellular processes. While over 500 kinases catalyze protein phosphorylation, only two enzymes, PP1 and PP2a, are responsible for >90% of all serine/ threonine phosphatase activity (1). Phosphatases, unlike kinases, achieve substrate specificity through complex subunit assembly and post-translational modifications rather than number. PP2a, for example, typically exists as heterotrimer with diverse subunits that may combinatorially make as many as 70 different holoenzyme assemblies (2). Mutations in several of these PP2a subunits have been identified in human cancers, suggesting that PP2a may act as a tumor suppressor (3). Adding further complexity, several residues of the catalytic subunit of PP2a can be reversibly phosphorylated, and the C-terminal leucine residue can be reversibly methylated (4,5). PME-1 is specifically responsible for demethylation of the carboxyl terminus (6).  Methylesterification is thought to control the binding of different subunits to PP2a, but little is known about physiological significance of this post-translational modification in vivo (7). Recently, PME-1 has been identified as a protector of sustained ERK pathway activity in malignant gliomas (8). In order to further elucidate the role of PP2a methylation in vivo, our lab has generated mice that lack PME-1 (PME-1 (-/-) mice) by targeted gene disruption (9). Unfortunately, PME-1 deletion resulted in perinatal lethality, underscoring the importance of PME-1 but hindering our biological studies. Biochemical elucidation of PME-1 would thus greatly benefit from the development of potent and selective chemical inhibitors (10).  References:  1. Oliver, C. J., Shenolikar, S. (1998).

This competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) assay uses fluorescence polarization to investigate enzyme-substrate functional interactions based on active site-directed molecular probes (11, 12). In this assay a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family (12) is used to label PME-1 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as PME-1 inhibitors will prevent PME-1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Omission of enzyme (which gives the same result as use of a catalytically-dead enzyme) will serve as a positive control. Compounds were tested at a nominal concentration of 5.9 micromolar.

They are also found in non-excitable tissues important for other functions such as hormone secretion, oxygen-sensing and immune responses. There are more than 100 genes in human genome encoding different but homologous potassium channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels, exemplified by the Shaker K+ channel, share considerable sequence similarity. Isolation and characterization of bioactive chemical probes could form important pharmacological foundation, providing a great deal of insights into the structure and function.   The KCNQ (or also called Kv7) channel family includes five members, KCNQ1 to KCNQ5; KCNQ are members of Kv channel superfamily[1-6]. Different from other Kv channel classes, KCNQ channels commonly display a sub-threshold opening (i.e., at a voltage near resting potential) and are regulated by GPCR signaling, e.g., muscarinic receptors [7, 8].  KCNQ2-5 channels are primarily expressed in the brain, while KCNQ1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue.  Among congenital long QT patients, a disease which affects 1 in 2,500 live births, the most prevalent mutations are within the KCNQ1 allele. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are known to cause benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC), a rare form of epilepsy [9].   Systemic compound screens for M-current have not been reported.  Because of the rapid progress of molecular cloning and functional characterization, KCNQ2 has been validated as the key molecular target of M-current.  It is therefore feasible to design non-biased high-throughput screens specifically targeting to KCNQ2 channels. This justifies use of the Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384-well format by FDSS for the identification of modulatory compounds acting on KCNQ2 from a large compound library.   Principle of the assay  The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [10]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ2 channels,  and the KCNQ2 potassium channel, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [11, 12].The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of KCNQ2 is inhibited by a test compound, the fluorescent signal is suppressed.

This assay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were measured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit.  Those CHO-K1 cells stably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed by the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and detected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound has a B-score of less than minus 3*SD of the average B score of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as a inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channel.   Protocol for the KCNQ2 project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells.  5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in darkness. 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on the Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (IC0), ICmax of XE-991  (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds). 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system. 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in darkness. 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4. 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline. 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds. 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0. 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [13]. 16. Calculate B scores [14] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more negative than -3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (<=-3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 2 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as an active (Value=2) inhibitor of the KCNQ2 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1).  18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation of INT(100*LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio)), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B Score inhibitor Ratio), B Score inhibitor Ratio, as in the result definition.

Description:  Reversible protein phosphorylation networks play essential roles in most cellular processes. While over 500 kinases catalyze protein phosphorylation, only two enzymes, PP1 and PP2a, are responsible for >90% of all serine/ threonine phosphatase activity (1). Phosphatases, unlike kinases, achieve substrate specificity through complex subunit assembly and post-translational modifications rather than number. PP2a, for example, typically exists as heterotrimer with diverse subunits that may combinatorially make as many as 70 different holoenzyme assemblies (2). Mutations in several of these PP2a subunits have been identified in human cancers, suggesting that PP2a may act as a tumor suppressor (3). Adding further complexity, several residues of the catalytic subunit of PP2a can be reversibly phosphorylated, and the C-terminal leucine residue can be reversibly methylated (4,5). Protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 (PME-1) is specifically responsible for demethylation of the carboxyl terminus (6).  Methylesterification is thought to control the binding of different subunits to PP2a, but little is known about physiological significance of this post-translational modification in vivo (7). Recently, PME-1 has been identified as a protector of sustained ERK pathway activity in malignant gliomas (8). In order to further elucidate the role of PP2a methylation in vivo, our lab has generated mice that lack PME-1 (PME-1 (-/-) mice) by targeted gene disruption (9). Unfortunately, PME-1 deletion resulted in perinatal lethality, underscoring the importance of PME-1 but hindering our biological studies. Biochemical elucidation of PME-1 and other protein modifiers such as lysophospholipases would thus greatly benefit from the development of potent and selective chemical inhibitors (10).

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of Protein Phosphatase Methylesterase 1 (PME-1)"" (AID 2130). This competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) assay uses fluorescence polarization to investigate enzyme-substrate functional interactions based on active site-directed molecular probes (11, 12). In this assay a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family (12) is used to label LYPLA1 in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as PME-1 inhibitors will prevent LYPLA1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Omission of enzyme (which gives the same result as use of a catalytically-dead enzyme) will serve as a positive control. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5.9 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT) containing 6.25 nanomolar of LYPLA1 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 10 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 15 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular). The well fluorescence polarization value (mP) was obtained via the PerkinElmer Viewlux software.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  Percent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) / ( median_Positive_Control_mP - median_Negative_Control_mP ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing LYPLA1 in the presence of test compound. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing LYPLA1 and DMSO. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing no LYPLA1 protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-2, for inactive 2-0.

Description:  Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels comprise a large family of cation channels, and have emerged as important sensors of cellular environment, including those for vision, taste, olfaction, hearing, touch, and thermo- and osmosensation [1].  TRP cationic channels are key molecules that are involved in a variety of diverse biological and pathological processes, ranging from neurological diseases [2], i.e. neuropathic pain [3], and cardiovascular diseases [4], to other diseases involving sensory physiology [5, 6].  Among the seven main subfamilies of TRP channels, separated according to structural homology, the TRPC (canonical) channels are among the first founding members of the TRP family [7, 8].  The TRPC subfamily is composed of seven members that are nonselective, calcium-permeable cation channels, which cause both a depolarization of the cell membrane potential and entry of calcium.  Disruption of TRPC function usually results in a change of risk factors in complex diseases, rather than an apparent phenotype.  The modulation of intracellular calcium as well as the membrane potential contributes to activation of transcription factors, apoptosis, vascular contractility, platelet activation, and cardiac hypertrophy, as well as normal and abnormal cell proliferation.  Currently there are no specific modulators available for TRPC isoforms, nor are there good common modulators available for all TRPC members [9].  The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that potentiate Ca2+ flux [10] in the presence of DAMGO at an EC20 concentration which, itself, minimally activates TRPC4 cation channels.  These compounds are considered, potentially, as allosteric potentiators/activators for TRPC4 cation channels.   Principle of the assay  To screen the allosteric activator/potentiator of the TRPC4 cation channels, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both TRPC4beta and mu-Opioid receptor was employed for the specific activation of TRPC4 cation channel.  Approximate 20% of activation is obtained by the application of DAMGO in an EC20 concentration. The TRPC4 cation channel activity was monitored by calcium flux with a commercial Fluo 4 kit [10].  Any compounds shown to increase the Fluo 4 fluorescence in the presence of DAMGO at EC20 concentrations were considered as allosteric hits for TRPC4.  Allosteric mu-Opioid receptor activators/potentiators will may be excluded through the counter- screen against HEK293 stable cells expressing the mu-Opioid receptor alone.

These compounds, with no activity in the absence of DAMGO, are considered, potentially, as allosteric potentiators/activators for TRPC4 cation channels.  A HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both TRPC4beta and mu-Opioid receptor is employed for the specific activation of the TRPC4 channel.  The activation of the mu-Opioid receptor by DAMGO, and, consequentially, the TRPC4 cation channel has been monitored with a Fluo 4 calcium flux kit.   The stable HEK293 cells were plated into 384-well plates.  After overnight incubation, the cells were loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye, Fluo 4, followed by a washing.  Then the cells were mounted on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader, and where compounds were added and incubated for 110 seconds, and their fluorescence were was measured for another 110 seconds upon the addition of a stimulus solution of DAMGO at EC20 concentration for another 110 seconds.  Compound effect was evaluated by the calculatedcalculating the Fluo 4 fluorescence ratio (Initial Ratio, see Result Definitions, 2) to remove the fluorescent test compounds, and the integrated ratio (an indicator of area under the kinetic calcium response curve) for B score calculation (B score AlloActivator Ratio , see Result Definitions, 1).  If the compound has an Initial Ratio of 0, AND causes more than 5 times the standard deviation of the B score AlloActivator RatioB-scores of the integrated ratios of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an allosteric potentiator/activator of the TRPC4 cation channels.   Protocol for the TRPC4 project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/high glucose medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/mL streptomycin, and 500 ug/mL G418 and 40 ug/mL hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 300,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul/well of 1x Fluo 4 solution to cells  5. Incubate 45 minutes at room temperature (RT) in the dark 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (EC0), and ECmax of DAMGO 7. Remove Fluo 4 dye solution and add 40 ul/well of assay buffer to cells 8. Remove 40 ul solution and add 20 ul/well of assay buffer to cells 9. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates. 11. Incubate all cell plates for 110 seconds at RT in the dark 12. Prepare EC20 DAMGO stimulus solution  13. Measure fluorescence for 5 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 14. Add 6 ul/well of EC20 DAMGO stimulus solution and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds 15. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 16. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [11]. 17. Calculate B scores [12] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 15. 18. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (>=3*SD), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (Value=2) as an allosteric potentiator of the TRPC4 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1).  19. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of Integer((Log10(abs([B score AlloActivator Ratio]))-1.1)*100);, they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B score AlloActivator Ratio), B score AlloActivator Ratio, as in the result definition.

Description:  During each cell cycle in eukaryotes, the genome must be completely replicated and this replication must begin at the correct time and site (initiation site or origin) (1). Pathogenic viruses often take advantage of this cellular precision to maintain replication of their own genome. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an orally-transmitted herpesvirus associated with numerous human neoplasms (2) that infects over 90% of the world's population (3). Latent EBV infection stimulates B cell proliferation in vitro, and can lead to B cell transformation (4). Following infection, the EBV genome is maintained in the host cell as a plasmid that is replicated by machinery comprised of several host proteins and a sole EBV protein, the EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1). This EBNA-1 protein is required for replication of the EBV DNA genome. EBNA-1 is a DNA-binding protein that binds to an EBV sequence called the viral origin of replication plasmid, OriP (5). Studies demonstrating a role for EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease (6), multiple sclerosis (7), lupus (8), infectious mononucleosis (9), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (10), combined with the recent discovery that EBNA-1 induces DNA double strand breaks (11), suggest that inhibitors of EBNA-1 and other proteins essential for EBV replication such as Zta (12), may serve useful for understanding virus-cell interactions, virus-mediated cellular transformation, and as therapies for EBV-associated pathologies.

Zta is a BZIP DNA binding domain-containing protein with homology to the cellular transcription factor c-fos (12). Zta is essential for EBV replication and is responsible for activation of the viral lytic cycle. This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1)"" (AID 1950). In this biochemical assay, purified full length Zta protein is incubated with Cyanine (Cy5)-labeled ZRE DNA in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, compounds that inhibit Zta will prevent Zta-ZRE binding, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) ZRE DNA probe, resulting in low fluorescence polarization in the well. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 11.1 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.9; 100 mM KCl; 1mM DTT; 5mM MgCl2; 200uM EDTA; 33.5ug/ml BSA; 10nM Cy5-ZRE probe) containing 225 nM of Zta protein was prepared and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, 4.0 microliters of this mixture were dispensed into 1536-well microtiter plates.  The assay started by dispensing 45 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (1.1% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Plates were then centrifuged and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, fluorescence polarization was read on an Envision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a Cy5 FP filter set (Excitation = 620nm, Emission = 688nm) and a Cy5 dichroic mirror. The well Fluorescence Polarization value (mP) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) polarization values corrected with the G factor value (G) using the following formula:  mP = 1000 * ( S - G * P ) / ( S + G * P )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Zta in the presence of test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Zta and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing no Zta protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-2, for inactives 2-0.

Description:  Numerous essential biological processes, including transcription and mitosis require the kinase-mediated phosphorylation of target proteins at serine and threonine residues, which leads to activation, inactivation, degradation, or subcellular relocalization of the specific target. The actions of these kinases are opposed by the serine/threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs). Although much is known about serine/threonine kinases, less data are available on the PPPs (1). One such PPP is protein phosphate 5 (PP5), a lipid-activated (1) enzyme with recently identified roles in hormone- and stress-induced signaling networks (2). Because purified full-length PP5 (499 residues) has low basal activity (3), it is believed that the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of PP5 depends upon formation of complexes with protein partners. Studies showing that PP5 is a negative regulator of Raf-1 (4), forms heterocomplexes with the glucocorticoid receptor and the chaperone Hsp90 (5), and that treatment of cells with PP5 antisense oligonucleotides leads to G1 growth arrest (6), suggest that PP5 plays a role in cellular proliferation and stress-induced signaling pathways. The complete substrate profile of PP5 remains unknown. As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of PP5 and other serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases such as PP1 may be useful for elucidating PPP action in normal and cancerous cells, identifying PP5 binding partners, and for discovery of potential therapeutic agents for human cancers.

This biochemical, fluorescence-based assay employs purified PP1alpha (catalytic subunit) and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) as the substrate. Cleavage of OMFP by PP1alpha converts OMFP to the fluorescent product 3-O-methylfluorescein. As designed, compounds that act as PP1alpha inhibitors will block PP1alpha catalytic activity, thereby decreasing OMFP cleavage and production of fluorescent product, resulting in reduced well fluorescence.

The plates were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The assay was started by dispensing 1 microliter of OMFP (400 micromolar in 3 mM HCl) to each well. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, 2 microliters of 300 mM potassium phosphate dibasic at pH 10.0 were added to each well to terminate the assay.  Well fluorescence was read on a PerkinElmer Viewlux using fluorescein filters: excitation wavelength of 480 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 540 nm (with 20 nm bandwidth).  The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  % Inhibition = ( RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing PP1 in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing PP1 and PP1 inhibitor. Low_Control is defined as wells containing no PP1 protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-15, for inactives 15-0.

Description:  Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels act as key regulators of many sensory systems including those for thermo-, photo-, and osmosensation [1-3].   A diversity of biological disorders has been linked to TRP channel malfunction ranging from neuropathic pain [4], cardiovascular diseases [5], to other diseases involving sensory physiology [6,7].  The TRP family of cation channels can be separated into seven subtypes according to structural similarity. Members of this family are nonselective cation channels that allow entry of extracellular calcium into cells resulting in a depolarization of membrane potential [8].  The mammalian TRPC (canonical) subfamily is proposed to function as store and second-messenger operated cation channels [9].  Disruption of TRPC may cause aberrant modulation of intracellular calcium and changes in membrane potential leading to activation of transcription factors, apoptosis, vascular contractility, platelet activation, and cardiac hypertrophy. Currently there are few pharmacological modulators of the TRPC family and no compounds known to target specific TRPC isoforms [10].  The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that increase intracellular Ca2+ levels [11] within HEK293 cells that express TRPC4 cation channels.  Compounds selected as TRPC4 activators will later be counter screened for specificity.   Principle of the assay  To screen for compounds that activate the TRPC4 cation channel, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both TRPC4beta and mu-Opioid receptor is employed.  Channel activity is monitored by calcium flux with a commercial Fluo4 kit [11]. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence are considered agonist hits.  mu-Opioid receptor activators/potentiators will be excluded through later counter-screening against HEK293 stable cells expressing the mu-Opioid receptor alone.

A HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both TRPC4beta and mu-Opioid receptor was employed, and channel activity monitored by use of Fluo4, a cell-permeable calcium sensitive dye. Compounds that activate TRC4 result in an increase of intracellular calcium and therefore increase the fluorescence of the dye.  The HEK293 stable cell line was seeded into 384-well plates.  After overnight incubation, the cells were loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye, Fluo4, followed by an assay buffer wash.  Cell plates were then loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader, where compounds were added and real-time fluorescence measured for 110 seconds. Library compound effect was evaluated by computing the integrated ratio of each well which was used for calculation and assignment of a B score for that well (B score Activator Ratio, see Result Definitions, 1).  Compounds that effected the fluorescence ratio within two seconds after application were flagged as fluorescent and removed from further analysis (Initial ratio, see Result Definitions, 2).  Remaining compounds that scored greater than five times the standard deviation plus the mean of the B score Activator Ratio of all library members were considered to be active as agonists of the TRPC4 cation channel.

Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [12] 14. Calculate B scores [13] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12 15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 5 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds (B score Activator Ratio>5*SD), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation plus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an activator of the TRPC4 channel.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). 16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 1 and 100 by calculation of Integer((Log10(abs([B score Activator Ratio]))-1.62)*100); they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B score Activator Ratio), B score Activator Ratio, as in the result definition.

They are also found in non-excitable tissues important for other functions such as hormone secretion, oxygen-sensing and immune responses. There are more than 100 genes in human genome encoding different but homologous potassium channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels, exemplified by the Shaker K+ channel, share considerable sequence similarity. Isolation and characterization of bioactive chemical probes could form important pharmacological foundation, providing a great deal of insights into the structure and function.   The KCNQ (or also called Kv7) channel family includes five members, KCNQ1 to KCNQ5; KCNQ are members of Kv channel superfamily[1-6]. Different from other Kv channel classes, KCNQ channels commonly display a sub-threshold opening (i.e., at a voltage near resting potential) and are regulated by GPCR signaling, e.g., muscarinic receptors [7, 8].  KCNQ2-5 channels are primarily expressed in the brain, while KCNQ1 is abundantly expressed in cardiac tissue.  Among congenital long QT patients, a disease which affects 1 in 2,500 live births, the most prevalent mutations are within the KCNQ1 allele. Mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are known to cause benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC), a rare form of epilepsy [9].   In the mid-90s, a compound known as D-23129, or retigabine, was initially developed to target GABAnergic signaling [10, 11].  Despite its poor effect on the GABA pathway, retigabine was shown to have potent anti-convulsant activity. In 1997, retigabine was also found to induce the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels at resting membrane potentials, and since then, through a variety of other studies, this has been established to be its main mechanism of action.  Retigabine, acting on KCNQ2/3 potassium channels which code M-currents, is now being used for treatment of epilepsy.  None of the anti-convulsants that are in clinical use today have a comparable mechanism of action, i.e., through ligand activation of voltage-gated potassium channels.  Several potentiation compounds are synthesized according to the scaffold of retigabine. However, considering the poor potency of retigabine and several other undesirable characteristics including its broad action on KCNQ2, 3, 4, and 5 [12], it is not clear whether these related structures will fundamentally improve therapeutic efficacy.  Hence, it argues for the performance of a non-biased screen for new structures with potentiation activity.  Systemic compound screens for M-current have not been reported.  Because of the rapid progress of molecular cloning and functional characterization, KCNQ2 has been validated as the key molecular target of M-current.  It is therefore feasible to design non-biased high-throughput screens specifically targeting to KCNQ2 channels. This justifies use of the Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384-well format by FDSS for the identification of modulatory compounds acting on KCNQ2 from a large compound library.   Principle of the assay  The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [13]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ2 channels,  and the KCNQ2 potassium channel, when bound to a dye, produces a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [14, 15].The binding to Tl+ causes increase in fluorescence. If activity of KCNQ2 is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increases.

This assay employs a CHO-K1 cell line that stably expresses the KCNQ2 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. As designed, compound effects on the KCNQ2 channel were measured by thallium assay, using a commercial kit, the FluxOR detection kit.  Those CHO-K1 cells stably expressing KCNQ2 channels were plated into 384-well plates.  On the following day, cells were loaded with a thallium-sensitive dye, FluxOR, and then incubated with assay buffer, followed by the addition of compounds.  Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and detected upon the addition of stimulus solution (2.5 mM K2SO4 and 2.5 mM Tl2SO4).The fluorescence of FluxOR was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as a potentiator of the KCNQ2 channel.

Description:  Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels act as key regulators of many sensory systems including those for thermo-, photo-, and osmosensation [1-3].   A diversity of biological disorders has been linked to TRP channel malfunction ranging from neuropathic pain [4], cardiovascular diseases [5], to other diseases involving sensory physiology [6,7].  The TRP family of cation channels can be separated into seven subtypes according to structural similarity. Members of this family are nonselective cation channels that allow entry of extracellular calcium into cells resulting in a depolarization of membrane potential [8].  The mammalian TRPC (canonical) subfamily is proposed to function as store and second-messenger operated cation channels [9].  Disruption of TRPC may cause aberrant modulation of intracellular calcium and changes in membrane potential leading to activation of transcription factors, apoptosis, vascular contractility, platelet activation, and cardiac hypertrophy. Currently there are few pharmacological modulators of the TRPC family and no compounds known to target specific TRPC isoforms [10].  The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that block activation of TRPC4 by second-messenger signaling [11] within HEK293 cells that stably express this channel and mu-opioid receptor.  Compounds selected as TRPC4 inhibitors will later be counter-screened for specificity.  Principle of the assay  To screen for compounds that inhibit the TRPC4 cation channel, a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both the TRPC4beta and the mu-Opioid receptor is employed.  Stimulation of the mu-Opioid receptor by DAMGO induces activation of TRPC4 through the G alpha signaling pathway.  Channel activity is monitored by calcium flux with a commercial Fluo4 kit [11]. Compounds that show decreased Fluo4 fluorescence in the presence of the mu-Opioid receptor activator (DAMGO, in ECmax concentration) are considered inhibitor hits.  mu-Opioid receptor inhibitors will be excluded through later counter-screening against HEK293 stable cells expressing the mu-Opioid receptor alone.

A HEK293 cell line which stably expresses both the TRPC4beta and mu-Opioid receptor was employed, and channel activity was monitored by use of Fluo4, a cell-permeable calcium-sensitive dye. Compounds that inhibit TRPC4 result in a decrease in calcium flux in the presence of a mu-Opioid receptor agonist, DAMGO.  This reduction in Ca2+ will result in a decreased fluorescence of Fluo4, as compared to control wells.  The HEK293 stable cell line was seeded into 384-well plates.  After overnight incubation, the cells were loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye, Fluo4, followed by an assay buffer wash.  Cell plates were then loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader, where compounds were added and incubated for 110 seconds, before application of a submaximal concentration of DAMGO.  Plates were again incubated for 110 seconds before application of DAMGO at a maximal activating concentration.  Real-time fluorescence was then measured for 100 seconds.  Library compound effect was evaluated by computing the integrated ratio of each well used for calculation and assignment of a B score for that well (B score Inhibitor Ratio, see Result Definitions, 1).  Compounds that affected the fluorescence ratio within two seconds after application were flagged as fluorescent and removed from further analysis (Initial ratio, see Result Definitions, 2).  Remaining compounds that scored less than the mean minus three times the standard deviation of the B score Inhibitor Ratio of all library members while also having a positive integrated ratio, were considered to be active as inhibitors of the TRPC4 cation channel.  Protocol for the TRPC4 project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/high glucose medium, supplemented with 10% Heat Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (HiFBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/mL streptomycin, 500 ug/mL G418 and 40 ug/mL hygromycin 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 300,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% HiFBS. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul/well of 1x Fluo4 solution to cells  5. Incubate 45 minutes at room temperature (RT) in the dark 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer (EC0), and ECmax of DAMGO 7. Remove Fluo4 dye solution and add 40 ul/well of assay buffer to cells 8. Remove 40 ul solution and add 20 ul/well of assay buffer to cells 9. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 5 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates. 12. Incubate plates for 110 seconds 13. Add submaximal concentration of DAMGO and incubate for 110 seconds 14. Add maximally activating concentration of DAMGO (DAMGO ECmax) and read for another 110 seconds. 15. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout 16. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [12] 17. Calculate B scores [13] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 15 18. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is less than the mean minus 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds (B score Inhibitor Ratio <-3*SD), the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 3 times the standard deviation plus the mean of the ratios of the complete library AND having a positive integrated ratio, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an inhibitor of the TRPC4 channel.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1). 19. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of Integer ((Log10(abs(B score Inhibitor Ratio))-0.7)*250); they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG10(B score Inhibitor Ratio), B score Inhibitor Ratio, as in the result definition.  The inactive test compounds are assigned a score of 0.  List of reagents  1. TRPC4 and mu-Opioid Receptor-expressing HEK293 Cells (provided by Assay Provider Michael Zhu, Ohio State University) 2.

Williamson External Assay ID: GLD1_INH_FP_1536_1X%INH  Name: Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of GLD-1 protein - TGE RNA interaction.  Description:  Post-transcriptional control of gene expression, such as alternative splicing and tissue-specific silencing, allow for great protein diversity (1). The elements in the mRNA 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) influence the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation of stem cells and germ cells (2). These elements are critical during spermatogenesis and oogenesis in hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes (3). GLD-1 (defective in Germ Line Development ) is a germline-specific protein and a member of the signal transduction and activation of RNA (STAR) family of RNA-binding proteins (4, 5), which are thought to link RNA metabolism to signal transduction pathways in invertebrates and vertebrates (4, 6). GLD-1 is found exclusively in the cytoplasm of germ cells (7), where it binds specifically to tra-2 mRNA GLI elements (TGEs) in the 3' UTRs of the mRNA produced by the sex determination gene, tra-2. Studies showing that gld-1 loss-of-function mutants make few or no sperm (8, 9), and that worm hermaphrodites with null mutations develop germ line tumors resulting from the inappropriate exit of germ cells from meiosis (7, 10), support a role for GLD-1 as a tumor suppressor, translational repressor, and important regulator of germ cell fate.

This biochemical assay employs a 5' fluorescein labeled 28mer RNA oligonucleotide containing the GLD-1 binding site (FL-TGE). In this assay, purified GLD-1 protein is incubated with the fluorescent RNA molecule in the presence of test compounds. The interaction of the labeled RNA molecule and GLD-1 increases the effective molecular mass of the labeled RNA, leading to an increase in the fluorescence polarization (FP) signal in the well. As designed, compounds that inhibit binding between GLD-1 and the FL-TGE RNA molecule will prevent the increase in the molecular mass of the labeled RNA, resulting in a decreased FP signal in the well. Test compounds are assayed in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 25 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml tRNA, 5 microgram/ml Heparin, 0.01% IGEPAL CA630, pH 8.0) with 500 nM of GLD-1 protein were dispensed into 1536-well microtiter plates.  The assay was started by dispensing 30 nL of test compound solubilized in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.6% final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, 2.5 microliters of Assay Buffer with 1 nM substrate FL-TGE were dispensed into 1536-well microtiter plates. The plates were then centrifuged and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Fluorescence polarization was read on the ViewLux (Perkin Elmer) using a FITC FP filter set (Excitation = 485 nm, Emission = 535 nm) and a dichroic mirror. The well Fluorescence Polarization value (mP) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) polarization values corrected with the G factor value (G) using the following formula: mP = 1000 * (S - G * P) / (S + G * P)  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  Percent inhibition = ( Test_Compound_mP - median_Low_Control_mP ) / ( median_High_Control_mP - median_Low_Control_mP ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing GLD1 and FL-TGE RNA in the presence of test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing GLD1 and FL-TGE RNA in the presence of DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing no GLD1 protein.  In addition, unlabeled TGE RNA fragment was used as positive control via competition with labeled FL-TGE.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-10, for inactive 10-0.

Description:  Nuclear receptors are small molecule- and hormone-regulated transcription factors with discrete DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains, and are essential during development and for maintenance of proper cell function in adults. Small pharmacological compounds that bind to the cleft of the ligand-binding domain could alter receptor conformation and subsequently modify transcription of target genes. Such ligands (agonists and antagonists) have been designed for 23 nuclear receptors among the 48 identified in the human genome (1-3). NR2E3 is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed exclusively in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina (4-7). In its unliganded state, NR2E3 acts as a transcriptional repressor (4, 8, 9) due to interaction with co-repressors such as retinal RetCOR (10), NCOR (11) or SMRT (11). Defects in this gene are a cause of several retinopathies (12-15). Studies showing that mice with a spontaneous deletion in the Nr2e3 gene develop late-onset, progressive retinal degeneration (7), suggest that this nuclear receptor is essential for photoreceptor development and survival. The identification of selective NR2E3 agonists would provide useful tools for the understanding of the biological role of NR2E3 in retinal diseases.  References: 1.

The assay employs GST-NR2E3 and its interaction partner, a biotinylated corepressor RetCOR. These reagents are added together in the presence of test compounds and Eu(K)-anti GST antibody and Streptavidin-D2. Interaction between the RetCOR and NR2E3 partners brings the fluorophore-tagged antibodies together, leading to FRET between the fluorophores. As designed, test compounds that act as NR2E3 agonists will lead to release of RetCOR from NR2E3, thereby preventing interaction of the fluorescent tags, leading to reduced well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.8 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay 5 microliters of Assay Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.05% NP-40 alternative, 6% glycerol, 100 mM potassium fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitiol and 0.05% w/v bovine serum albumin) were dispensed into columns 1 and 2 of 1536-well assay plates. Next, 5 microliters of 1.05X Assay Mixture containing 1.42 nM GST-tagged NR2E3 and 7.35 biotinylated RetCOR in Assay Buffer were dispensed into the remaining 46 columns. The compounds were then pinned into each assay plate. Column 3 of each plate contained 10 #M biotin as high control. Next, 1 microliter of 6X Detection Mix containing 4.5 nM Eu(K)-anti-GST and 252 nM Streptavidin-D2 in Assay Buffer was dispensed into all wells. After dispensing, final concentrations of the different reagents were: 0.75 nM Eu(K)-anti GST, 42 nM Streptavidin-D2, 1.35nM GST-tagged NR2E3 and 7 nM biotinylated RetCOR. The plates were then incubated for 5 hours at 4 degrees Celsius and well FRET was measured. After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 617 nm (Eu(K)) and 671 nm (D2) with the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I671nm / I617nm x 10,000  Where:  I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm and; I617nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 617nm.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using as follows:  % Inhibition = 100 x ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_TestCompound - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) / ( Median_Ratio_LowControl - Median_Ratio_HighControl ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing biotin. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing 0.6% DMSO.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater %inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-20, for inactive 20-0.

Where the mean is the mean of all of the valid wells on the plate and the STDDev is the standard deviation of all of the wells on the plate.    Compounds with a  z-score of >=3.5 (~3.5 standard deviations from the mean value of the plate) are defined as actives in this assay.    To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary and single-concentration confirmation screening data.  a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, zScore < 3.5, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, zScore >= 3.5, then the assigned score is 20 d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30. This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21. 2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",,,,,uHTS identification of small molecules that induce b-cell replication in the MIN-6 cell line,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A277-bCell-MIN6-Agonist-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-02-18,,330480,956,329524,330392,956,329437,1.2,Live,,,,cell-based format,cell-proliferation assay,luminescence method

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, disease-associated mutations (1-4). Certain GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways for neuropeptides such as oxytocin, serotonin, and vasopressin, and influence complex social behaviors such as trust, anxiety, and parenting (5). Oxytocin receptor (OXTR: OTR) activity is mediated by G proteins (Gαq, Gαi, and Gβγ) which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (6, 7). OTR belongs to the class A (rhodopsin-like) GPCR family shared with the vasopressin receptors (8), and is expressed in the brain, uterus, and mammary glands. Studies showing a role for OTR in autism (9), defective lactation and nurturing behavior (10), and altered social behavior and aggression (10) suggest that the identification of small molecules that act as agonists of OTR activity may serve as useful tools in OTR biology and as potential therapeutic agents for human behavioral disorders.

In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses OTR is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-OTR cells. As designed, compounds that act as OTR agonists will increase calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-OTR cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, oxytocin (75 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound- Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Oxytocin.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 95 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC15 average response) and test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC15 average response) and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Oxytocin (EC100) and DMSO.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-23, for inactive 61-0.

Expression of activator BH3-only proteins, such as BIM or tBID, leads to downstream caspase activation and apoptosis. A1 can functionally bind to and sequester BIM or tBID. In this assay, the parental control cells do not depend on A1 for survival. However, they can be primed to depend on A1 by co-expressing A1 and BIM. The primed cells still maintain a balance between anti and pro-apoptotic proteins, but rely on A1 to sequester BIM. An A1 inhibitor causes the release of A1-bound BIM, which activates BAX/BAK, and leads to caspase activation that can be quantitatively measured using a luciferin-linked caspase substrate (peptide sequence DEVD) available commercially as Promega's Caspase Glo 3/7 reagent.   Expected Outcome:  Compounds that cause caspase activation will show an increase in luminescence signal as measured by the caspase glo reagent.  Additional assays will determine whether this caspase activation is being caused by general toxicity or off target effects (as is the case for the nonspecific positive control, clofoctol) or due to the on-target disruption of the A1-BIM interaction (as is the case for the specific but weaker positive control, ABT-263, which mimics the BH3 homology domain of BIM.)","Assay Protocol: 1. MEF cells expressing A1-2A-BIM are cultured in 150mm TC dishes with 30mls of growth media supplemented with 0.5-1 ug/ml blasticidin in a 37oC incubator (5% CO2). Use 30 ml media for a 150 mm dish. Do let cells go beyond 95% confluency (about 30X106 cells per 150mm dish). Split cells 1 to 6-10 (3-4X106 cells) for subsequent passage every other day.  2. Day1 morning. MEF cells grow on T200 mm cell culture flasks are washed once with 1XPBS (Gibco), and digested with 1ml (or 3ml) 1X trypsin (CellGro Mediatech) for 1-2 minutes. 3. Add 10ml complete growth media (RPMI-1640 (Cellgrow Mediatech), 10% heat inactivated FBS (Thermo), 1X penn/strep/glutamine (Gibco)) to the plate, mix cells and break clumps, then transfer the cells  to a 50ml centrifuge tube through a cell strainer (BD Falcon # 352340) to get rid of any clumps. Count the cells, and centrifuge cells at 1000 rpm for 4 minutes.  4. Aspirate off the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in complete media at density of 1X105 cells/ml. 5. Plate cells in white 384 well plates (Corning 3570), 30ul/well (2500 cells/well), with Combi (Thermo) while gently stirring the media.  6. Day2. Pin transfer 50 nL of compound to the cells and incubate 37 degrees 5% CO2 95% humidity for 3 hours.  7. Remove the plate from the incubator and cool down to room temperature for 30 minutes.  8. Add 10ul of 1:1 diluted CaspaseGlo (Promega) (diluted with 50mM HEPES) to each well with Combi multidrop (Thermo.) Shake the plate on the Combi nest for 1 minute. Incubate at room temperature for 1h.  9. Measure luminescence in Envision (Perkin Elmer)","HTS Data Analysis: 32 negative control wells (DMSO) were included on every plate.  Positive controls were run on separate plates, and their activity values calibrated and applied to each assay plate.  Compound activity was scaled to the negative and positive control, with DMSO activity measuring 0% and positive control measuring 100% activity.  Pattern correction was performed by Genedata software using a runwise additive algorithm.   The PubChem_Activity_Score was derived using the follow procedure: 1. A background-subtracted value was calculated for each well by subtracting the median value of the negative control wells on each plate from the value of each well on that plate.  2. An activity score was derived for each well by dividing the background-subtracted value for each well by the median of the background-subtracted value of the clofoctol positive control wells in the same run and multiplying the resulting fraction by 100.  3. Runwise patterns were smoothed using an additive algorithm in Genedata software  4. The final PubChem_Activity_Score represents the mean of all valid replicate activity scores obtained.  The PubChem_Activity_Outcome class was assigned as described below:  Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive) PubChem_Activity_Score for more than half the replicate activity scores <10.  Activity_Outcome = 2 (active) PubChem_Activity_Score for more than half the replicate activity scores >10, or one half of replicates had a replicate activity score >10 and the PubChem_Activity_Score was >10.

Apelin is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) APJ (angiotensin II receptor-like 1, AGTRL-1 and APLNR). Until the discovery of apelin, APJ was an orphan GPCR. APJ is coupled to Gai, and has been shown in cell culture to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The APJ gene encodes a receptor that most closely resembles the angiotensin receptor AT1. However, the APJ receptor does not bind angiotensin II. Underscoring the emerging importance of the apelin/APJ system, recent studies have shown that apelin reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice, and opposes the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Additional research has revealed that APJ forms a heterodimer with the Ang II receptor AT1, and that this complex facilitates antagonism of Ang II signaling by apelin. Despite these exciting results, there remains a multitude of unanswered questions regarding the role of apelin and APJ in physiology and pathology.  The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of apelin receptor function that transiently and reversibly activates the receptor. An agonist or potentiator of this receptor would provide a novel research tool to evaluate the role of apelin in cardiovascular and metabolic disease pathology. In this description we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the APJ receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal.","A.

APs are dimeric enzymes found in most organisms. In human, four isozymes of APs have been identified. One isozyme is tissue-nonspecific (designated TNAP) and three other isozymes are tissue-specific and named according to the tissue of their predominant expression: intestinal (IAP), placental (PLAP) and germ cell (GCAP) alkaline phosphatases. IAP expression is largely restricted to the gut, especially to the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the small intestinal mucosa. The exact biological function of IAP is unknown.   The goal of this HTS is to identify novel and specific activators of human IAP. The only known to date class of alkaline phosphatases activators are hydroxyl-containing compounds, such as diethanolamine (DEA), that act as phosphoacceptor substrate and exhibit its effect in high-mM concentration range. Compounds with a similar mode of action are expected to demonstrate diminished stimulating potential if tested in the presence of high concentration of DEA. Therefore, for detection of compounds with diverse mode of action, the HTS campaign was performed in the presence close-to-Km DEA concentration. ","Materials: 1.

Modification of proteins by SUMO is a dynamic and reversible process. SUMOylation/deSUMOylation cycle regulates SUMOs function. Sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) are involved in both the maturation of SUMO precursors (endopeptidase cleavage) and deconjugation of the targets (isopeptidase cleavage) [1-3]. There are seven SENPs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) in humans, and several of these have been characterized as SUMO (or Nedd8) specific enzymes. SENP8 is not a SUMO protease, instead it functions on a small ubiquitin related protein Nedd8. The objective of this project is to generate small molecule inhibitors specific for SENP8 (the deNEDDylating enzyme).  1536-well chemiluminescent screening assay utilizes RLRGG-aminoluciferin peptide substrate and is based on SENP8-dependent deconjugation of the aminoluciferin, which serves as a substrate for the coupled luciferase.  This screening assay was developed and performed at the Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (SBCCG) as part of the Molecular Library Screening Center Network (MLSCN).   1.

APs are dimeric enzymes found in most organisms. In human, four isozymes of APs have been identified. One isozyme is tissue-nonspecific (designated TNAP) and three other isozymes are tissue-specific and named according to the tissue of their predominant expression: intestinal (IAP), placental (PLAP) and germ cell (GCAP) alkaline phosphatases. IAP expression is largely restricted to the gut, especially to the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the small intestinal mucosa. The exact biological function of IAP is unknown.   IAP is inhibited by a number of inhibitors (1). They include L-phenylalanine, (2, 3), L-tryptophan (4), L-leucine and phenylalanine-glycylglycine (5). While the biological implications of this inhibition are not known, these inhibitors have proven to be useful in the differential determination of AP isozymes as important diagnostic markers in many diseases. However, these known inhibitors of IAP are not entirely specific for IAP isozyme and have milllimolar affinity. In addition, they are common aminoacids that are ubiquitously present in the tissues and involved in diverse metabolic pathways, and therefore, are not appropriate tools for biological studies. Thus, the aim of this MLSCN probe project is to obtain novel chemical scaffolds that can be used as chemical probes.","Materials: 1. IAP - provided by Dr. Jose Luis Millan 2.

One subfamily, the canonical TRP (TRPC) channels, are nonselective cation channels activated by a multitude of biophysical and biochemical stimuli [2-4].  There are currently seven mammalian isoforms within this channel subfamily, six of which encode functional proteins in humans.  Genetic analysis has suggested a link between TRPC mutations and many human pathologies including cardiovascular diseases [5], respiratory diseases [6], kidney diseases [7], and cancer [8]. However, validation of TRP channel malfunction as a cause for these diseases has been a slow process due to the paucity of specific modulators of this channel family.  To date there are no known isoform specific activators, nor are there small molecules that specifically target TRP channels as a whole [9].    It is therefore the goal of this screen to identify small molecule probes that activate TRPC6 heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells.  Those compounds selected as hits will later be counter screened for selectivity.                Principle of the assay  To screen for small molecule activators of the canonical transient receptor potential cation channel 6, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing TRPC6 is employed and channel activity is monitored through a commercially available membrane potential dye (MPD).  The activation of TRPC6 will cause influx of calcium ions into the cell resulting in a depolarization of plasma membrane potential [10].  Compounds that cause depolarization and therefore, increase MPD fluorescence are considered TRPC6 activator hits.  Those small molecules that evoke membrane depolarization through auxiliary mechanisms will be excluded through later counter-screening using HEK293 cells that do not express TRPC6.

A HEK293 cell line which stably expresses TRPC6 was employed, and channel activity monitored by use of a membrane potential dye (MPD). Compounds that activate TRC6 result in membrane depolarization. This change in membrane potential will result in an increased fluorescence of MPD as compared to control wells.   The HEK293 stable cell line was seeded into 384-well plates.  After overnight incubation, the cells were loaded with MPD. Cell plates were then loaded onto a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader, where test compounds were added real-time fluorescence was measured for 110 seconds. Library compound effect was evaluated by computing the integrated ratio of each well which was used for calculation and assignment of a B score (B score activator Ratio, see Result Definitions, 1).  Compounds that affect the fluorescence ratio within two seconds after application were flagged as fluorescent and removed from further analysis.  Remaining compounds that scored greater than three times the standard deviation plus the mean of the B score Activator Ratio of all library members were considered to be activators of the TRPC6 cation channel.

One subfamily, the canonical TRP (TRPC) channels, are nonselective cation channels gated by intracellular calcium stores, ligand binding, or mechanical force [2-4]. TRPC channel genes have been linked to many diseases; however, the only channelopathy associated with a single TRPC channel, TRPC6, is Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [5].  A gain of function mutation in TRPC6 causes severe proteinuria and disrupted calcium regulation in children and adults [6-7]. As there are no known specific inhibitors of TRPC6, nor are their known specific inhibitors of TRP channels as a whole, it has been difficult to understand the role of TRPC6 in this disease [8]. It is therefore of great interest to find a specific modulator of this TRP isoform.   Principle of the assay To screen for small molecule inhibitors of TRPC6, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing TRPC6 is employed.  Stimulation of endogenous muscarinic receptors by acetylcholine will induce activation of TRPC6 through a Galphaq signaling pathway [3].  Channel activity is monitored through a commercially available FLIPR membrane potential dye [9].  Activation of TRPC6 will cause influx of calcium ions into the cell resulting in a depolarization of plasma membrane potential.  Compounds that are shown to inhibit this depolarization in the presence of acetylcholine (ECMax) will be considered inhibitor hits.  Compounds that inhibit membrane depolarization through parallel mechanisms will be excluded through later counter-screening using HEK293 cells that do not express TRPC6.

The novel assay is a result of an R01 (HL081062) which has taken advantage of compounds identified through an earlier project X01MH077638 (entitled ""MLSCN Assay for Allosteric Regulators of the VLA-4 Integrin"") that screened a portion of the MLSMR for allosteric regulators of VLA-4. This approach uses an improved assay to search for novel integrin ligands that block the binding of traditional ligands and do not in themselves induce the LIBS mAb binding site. Molecules of this type are unknown for VLA-4. As configured, the new assay could identify for the first time allosteric regulators of VLA-4 as well as competitive inhibitors that do not induce LIBS. This assay is a homogeneous flow cytometry based assay for the detection of ligand occupied binding pocket using conformationally sensitive mAbs. We tested several VLA-4 integrin ligands for the induction of LIBS, and confirmed that the binding of mAbs showed a good correlation with Kds determined in a competition assay with a fluorescent ligand. Two secondary assays validated previously in our laboratory will verify the screen and reduce the number of actives for follow up. Tertiary assays for selectivity and mechanism of action will guide the SAR chemistry.    From a therapeutic point of view integrins are the most important class of cell adhesion receptors that mediate cell to cell, or cell to extracellular matrix adhesion. VLA-4 (very late antigen 4, alpha4beta1-integrin, CD49d/CD29) plays a major role in the regulation of immune cell recruitment to inflamed endothelia and sites of inflammation. It participates in antigen presenting cell and lymphocyte interactions, retention and mobilization of immature progenitors in the bone marrow, cancer cell trafficking, metastasis and other events. Integrins represent an attractive target for several existing drugs for treatment of inflammatory diseases, anti-angiogenic therapy, and anti-thrombotic therapy. Integrin ligands can also be used as imaging tools [Alghisi 2006,Tucker 2006, Vanderslice and Woodside 2006, Woodside and Vanderslice 2008], as well as probes for studies of integrin functional activity and molecular conformation (Chigaev et al 2001, 2003, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2003, 2004]. Several classes of small-molecule integrin inhibitors have been developed. Competitive antagonists (ligand-mimetic) bind directly to the integrin ligand binding pocket and thus disrupt ligand-receptor interaction. In recent work, we showed that these ligands induce conformational changes detected as Ligand Induced Binding Sites (LIBS). Allosteric antagonists, a next generation of compounds with high selectivity and potency, have been developed primarily for alphaLbeta2- integrin (LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) [Shimaoka 2003]. No allosteric antagonists for alpha4beta1-integrin have been described. The goal of our research is to discover small molecule allosteric antagonists for alpha4beta1-integrin that do not induce LIBS. The proposed high throughput screening (HTS) of the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) is intended to result in novel lead compounds. The HTS will use a unique method for the detection of ligand#binding pocket occupancy based upon binding of mAbs recognizing ligand induced binding sites (LIBS). This method has been validated for several known and newly discovered alpha4beta1-integrin (VLA-4 (very late antigen 4, CD49d/CD29)) ligands. Since LIBS mAbs are available for many integrins, this approach is expected to be generally applicable. ","The assay is performed in 384-well microtiter plates.   Five microL of RPMI is added to columns 2-24. Test compounds in DMSO are added and mixed (0.1 microL of 1 milliM stock solution). This results in 20 microM of test compounds (6.7 microM final in 15 microL). Compounds are added to 320 wells (columns 3-22). Column 2 is used for the negative control (no VLA-4 ligand added). Columns 23, 24 are used for the positive control (no test compounds added). Five microL aliquots of U937 cells suspended in RPMI 1640 (at 3 X 10^6 cells/milliL) are loaded in 384 well microplates, and mixed (1 X 10^6 cells/milliL final). Column 1 is left empty for flow cytometry data binning purposes.   Next, 5 microL mixture of a non fluorescent VLA-4 ligand (108 nanoM stock solution of LDV, 36 nanoM final) with HUTS-21 PE antibodies (75 microL/milliL stock, 25 microL/milliL final) are added to the columns 3-24 and mixed. This concentration of LDV (36 nanoM) is equal to three times the dissociation constant (Kd) of LDV. 5 microL aliquot of HUTS-21 PE antibodies without LDV (75 microL/milliL stock, 25 microL/milliL final)) added to a column 2, which is used as a negative control (only non-specific binding of mAbs will be detected). Addition of the ligand will induce LIBS and therefore initiate binding of antibodies. Plates are incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. According to the real-time kinetic studies this time is sufficient to reach equilibrium. Wells are sampled using a high throughput flow cytometry platform (HyperCyt, IntelliCyt, Albuquerque, NM). ""Sip time"" of approximately 1 second is sufficient to deliver several thousand cells for analysis per well (~10 min per plate).  After data acquisition, proprietary software is used to analyze the data files (HyperView, UNMCMD, developed by Bruce Edwards). This software automatically resolves data clusters of cells into 368 time bins, or wells with cells, per plate, and analyzes each bin to determine mean or median fluorescence intensity (MFI).  The data are exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet template, and the value of the antibody binding inhibition (%Inhibition) is calculated for each well as follows: % Inhibition= 100(1-((MFItest-MFIneg.control)/(MFIpos.control-MFIneg.control))) where MFI is median fluorescence intensity of cells with test compounds, positive or negative control wells.  PUBCHEM_SCORE is based on the %Inhibition (PUBCHEM_SCORE = %Inhibition) with the limits of %Inhibition < 0 are given PUBCHEM_SCORE = 0 and %Inhibition > 100 are given PUBCHEM_SCORE = 100.  Negative %Inhibition are primarily due to test compounds with innate fluorescence.  A compound is deemed active if the %Inhibition is greater than 50%.  This cutoff corresponds to about three times the standard deviation of %Inhibition from 'non-fluorescent' test compounds.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay demonstrated by a compound at 10 uM concentration: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",SUMO-1-specific protease,,,,uHTS Luminescent assay for identification of inhibitors of Sentrin-specific protease 6 (SENP6),Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A328-SENP6-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-03-18,,330480,5820,324660,330392,5817,324577,1.2,Live,single protein format,coupled enzyme activity assay,bioluminescence,,,

Description:  M. tuberculosis is a pervasive human intracellular pathogen [1] and causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) [2]. A major clinical obstacle to TB treatment is the bacterial latency that results in antibiotic resistance [2]. Standard chemotherapeutic treatment involves antibiotic cocktail regimens characterized by poor patient compliance and greater drug resistance [2]. Although alveolar macrophages attempt to destroy inhaled M. tuberculosis via acidification in lysosomes, M. tuberculosis can maintain its pH in this acidic environment and remain virulent. Recently, the membrane-associated serine protease Rv3671c was identified as the enzyme involved in conferring acid resistance in M. tuberculosis [3]. Additional data showing that Rv3671c is involved in the growth of M. tuberculosis in rodent models of infection [3] and in the hypersensitivity of M. tuberculosis to stress factors [4], suggest that Rv3671c plays a critical role in M. tuberculosis virulence and survival. The substrate specificity and signaling pathways activated by Rv3671c remain uncharacterized. As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of Rv3671c would improve our understanding of the role of Rv3671c in M. tuberculosis acid-resistance, and may lead to therapeutic tools for the treatment of TB.

This is a competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) assay which uses fluorescence polarization to investigate enzyme- substrate functional interactions based on active site-directed molecular probes [12-14]. In the assay, a fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) probe which broadly targets enzymes from the serine protease family [15-16] is used to label Rv3671c in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. The assay is performed by incubating test compounds with the extracellular domain of Rv3671c, followed by addition of the FP-rhodamine probe and measurement of fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as Rv3671c inhibitors will prevent Rv3671c-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 3.75 micromolar of Rv3671c protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 180 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 15 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing Rv3671c and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Rv3671c in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no Rv3671c protein.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-7, for inactive 7-0.

The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3):      The median raw signal of the intraplate NC wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0.      The median raw signal of the intraplate PC wells was set to a normalized activity value of -100. Experimental wells were scaled to this range, giving an activity score as percent change in signal relative to the intraplate controls.  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)' in Genedata applied to the normalized plate data.  The replicate activity scores were multiplied by -1 to convert Genedata negative percent inhibition values to Pubchem positive percent activity values. The final PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE was set as equal to the most active replicate.  The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME class was assigned as described below, based on an activity threshold of 25%:       Activity_Outcome = 1 (inactive)      None of the replicates fell outside the threshold.

Individual subtypes of these potassium channels often have a unique expression pattern allowing cells to ""fine-tune"" membrane potentials and excitability according to their respective physiological functions [4]. Dysfunctions of these electrical excitability controlling proteins, either congenital or acquired, are attributed to a variety of diseases [5,6], such as cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, hypertension, and epilepsy. Specific modulation of individual potassium channel types therefore represents an enormous potential for the development of physiological tool compounds and new drugs [7-9].  KCNQ1 (Kv7.1, KvLQT) [10,11] is an alpha-subunit subtype of voltage-gated KCNQ potassium channel family, which is composed of five members of KCNQ1-KCNQ5. They share between 30% and 65% amino acid identity. A classical KCNQ alpha-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, including a voltage-sensor segment and a pore domain [12-15]. Unique from other members of KCNQ family [16], KCNQ1 has been generally absent from neuronal tissues, mainly expressed in heart, kidney, small intestine, pancreas, prostate and other non-excitable epithelial tissues. Also contrast to other members of KCNQ family which form both alpha-subunit homo- and heterotetrameric channels, KCNQ1 channels only form alpha-subunit homotetramers [10]. They commonly co-assemble with beta-subunit KCNE proteins to give rise to functional variations in different tissues.  These molecular assemblies have afforded KCNQ1 with two important physiological functions: 1) repolarization of the cardiac tissue following an action potential and 2) water and salt transport in epithelial tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary long QT syndrome, diabetics [18], Romano-Ward syndrome, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome [19] and familial atrial fibrillation [20], as well as impairment of cyclic AMP-stimulated intestinal secretion of chloride ions related to cystic fibrosis [21,22] and pathological forms of secretary diarrhea [23-25]. Furthermore, drug-induced acquired KCNQ1 and KCNQ1/KCNE dysfunctions also raise concerns of KCNQ1/KCNE as potential hERG-like drug safety issue in pharmaceutical development [17].  For their pharmacological responses, KCNQ1/KCNE heteromultimers function differently from KCNQ1 alone. Initial discovery of KCNQ1 modulators is focused on the KCNQ1 (and KCNQ1/KCNE1 IKs) inhibitors [17], from earlier Chromonal 293B[26], linopirdine and XE991[27], to new family of potent inhibitors, i.e. Merck-IKs (IC50 ~0.08 nM), JNJ 303(IC50 0.064 uM) and JNJ282 (IC50 0.001 uM).   Systemic compound screens for KCNQ1 and its heteromultimers have not been reported. Here the assay, Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384 format by FDSS, therefore, was used for the identification of inhibitory compounds acting on KCNQ1 from a large MLSMR compound library.     Principle of the assay  The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [28]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence. Upon the addition of Tl+ onto cells expressing potassium channels, in this case, KCNQ1 potassium channel, extracellular Tl+ flux into cells through open KCNQ1 channels, and when bound to the dye, produce a fluorescent signal that is monitored in real-time by a fluorescence imaging plate reader [29, 30].

This assay employs CHO-K1 cells line that stably expresses KCNQ1 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a commercially available thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound has a B score less than the mean plus 3 standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an inhibitor of the KCNQ1 channels.   Protocol for the KCNQ1 project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells  5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in the dark 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer(IC0), activator control R-L3 and inhibitor control XE991 (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds) 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in the dark 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [31]. 16. Calculate B scores [32] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (<=3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 3 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (Value=2) as an inhibitor of the KCNQ1 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1).  18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 4 and 100 by calculation of INT(((LOG(Abs([Bscore Ratio]))-0.747)/0.828)*100), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG (Abs([Bscore Ratio]), Bscore Ratio, as in the result definition.

Individual subtypes of these potassium channels often have a unique expression pattern allowing cells to ""fine-tune"" membrane potentials and excitability according to their respective physiological functions [4]. Dysfunctions of these electrical excitability controlling proteins, either congenital or acquired, are attributed to a variety of diseases [5,6], such as cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, hypertension, and epilepsy. Specific modulation of individual potassium channel types therefore represents an enormous potential for the development of physiological tool compounds and new drugs [7-9].  KCNQ1 (Kv7.1, KvLQT) [10,11] is an alpha-subunit subtype of voltage-gated KCNQ potassium channel family, which is composed of five members of KCNQ1-KCNQ5. They share between 30% and 65% amino acid identity. A classical KCNQ alpha-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, including a voltage-sensor segment and a pore domain [12-15]. Unique from other members of KCNQ family [16], KCNQ1 has been generally absent from neuronal tissues, mainly expressed in heart, kidney, small intestine, pancreas, prostate and other non-excitable epithelial tissues. Also contrast to other members of KCNQ family which form both alpha-subunit homo- and heterotetrameric channels, KCNQ1 channels only form alpha-subunit homotetramers [10]. They commonly co-assemble with beta-subunit KCNE proteins to give rise to functional variations in different tissues.  These molecular assemblies have afforded KCNQ1 with two important physiological functions: 1) repolarization of the cardiac tissue following an action potential and 2) water and salt transport in epithelial tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary long QT syndrome, diabetics [18], Romano-Ward syndrome, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome [19] and familial atrial fibrillation [20], as well as impairment of cyclic AMP-stimulated intestinal secretion of chloride ions related to cystic fibrosis [21,22] and pathological forms of secretary diarrhea [23-25]. Furthermore, drug-induced acquired KCNQ1 and KCNQ1/KCNE dysfunctions also raise concerns of KCNQ1/KCNE as potential hERG-like drug safety issue in pharmaceutical development [17].  For their pharmacological responses, KCNQ1/KCNE heteromultimers function differently from KCNQ1 alone. Initial discovery of KCNQ1 modulators is focused on the KCNQ1 (and KCNQ1/KCNE1 IKs) inhibitors [17]. In contrast to KCNQ1 channel blockers, only until recently have KCNQ1 channel activators/ potentiators been generating a lot of interests partially due to KCNQ1/KCNE activators might be useful agents to counteract the loss of delayed rectifier function in LQT syndromes, as well as counter target of other KCNQ family members for potential drugs for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Overall there are a very limited number of KCNQ1 activators/ potentiators, a further limited number of KCNQ1/E1 heteromultimer-specific modulators, and no reported KCNQ1/E2 or KCNQ1/E3 heteromultimer-specific modulators. This has hindered a more systematic study to understand the roles of on beta-subunits. Therefore it justifies the necessity of primary high throughput screen of KCNQ1 with the MLSMR library of >300,000-500,000 compounds covering large chemical space. Here the assay, Tl+-based fluorescence assay in 384 format by FDSS, therefore, was used for the identification of activating/potentiating compounds acting on KCNQ1 from the large MLSMR compound library.   Principle of the assay  The Tl+ ion, which is permeable through potassium channels, serves as a surrogate for K+ flux [26]. The thallium-sensitive dye is loaded into cells, and, in the absence of Tl+, exhibits very low basal fluorescence.

If the activity of KCNQ1 is potentiated by a test compound, the fluorescent signal increase is enhanced.

This assay employs CHO-K1 cells line that stably expresses KCNQ1 potassium channel. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular thallium, as monitored by a commercially available thallium-sensitive fluorescent dye, FluxOR. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated FluxOR fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound has a B score that is higher than the mean plus 3 standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as a potentiator/activator of the KCNQ1 channels.   Protocol for the KCNQ1 project:  1. Cell culture: Cells are routinely cultured in DMEM/F12 medium, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 500 ug/ml G418. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 120,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2 4. Remove medium and add 25 ul /well of 1x FluxOR solution to cells  5. Incubate 90 minutes at room temperature (RT) in the dark 6. Prepare 7.5X compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer; controls are assay buffer(IC0), activator control R-L3 and inhibitor control XE991 (all with DMSO concentrations matched to that of test compounds) 7. Remove FluxOR dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells 8. Add 4 ul of 7.5x compound stock into the cell plates via Cybi-Well system 9. Incubate all cell plates for 20 minutes at RT in the dark 10. Prepare 5x stimulus buffer containing 12.5 mM K2SO4 and 12.5 mM Tl2SO4 11. Load cell plates to Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 12. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 13. Depolarize cells with 6 ul/well of stimulus buffer and continue measuring fluorescence for 110 seconds 14. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 15. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [29]. 16. Calculate B scores [30] for test compounds using ratios calculated in Step 14. 17. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of ratios of the library compounds (>=3*SD), AND the B score of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation of the B scores of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (Value=2) as an potentiator of the KCNQ1 channels.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1).  18. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 0 and 100 by calculation of INT(((LOG(ABS([Ratio Bscore Pot]))-0.850)/1.529)*100), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG([Ratio Bscore Pot]), Ratio Bscore Pot as in the result definition.

Burhans, Ph.D.   Assay Implementation: Catherine Prudom Ph.D., Chris Allen Ph.D., Anna Waller Ph.D, Mark Carter MS Assay technical support:  Travis Houston, Keon Ahghar, Stephanie Sedillo  Assay Background and Significance:  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of growth signaling pathways are important components of aging and contribute to a variety of age-related pathologies, including neoplastic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [Halazonetis et al 2008, Lu and Finkel, 2008, Herrup and Yang 2007]. Recent findings point to DNA replication stress downstream of growth signaling by ROS and other molecules as an equally important factor in aging and the development of these diseases [Weinberger 2007]. The proposed screen is designed to identify compounds that mimic caloric restriction by down-regulating growth signaling pathways, thus reducing the accumulation of superoxide anions and promoting a tighter growth arrest in G1. The primary readout for this screen will be measurements of superoxide using the fluorogenic compound dihydroethidium (DHE). Based on our recent discovery that isonicotinamide, an activator of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, enhances chronological lifespan at the same time that it reduces superoxide levels, we expect that our screen will identify compounds that activate sirtuins [Longo and Kennedy 2006]. Our screen should also identify drugs that inhibit additional targets functioning in the diverse array of growth regulatory pathways operating independently of sirtuins [Burhans 2007]. Given the complexity of growth regulatory pathways, caloric restriction mimics that target multiple growth signaling pathways, either alone or in combination with other drugs, may be more effective than drugs that target individual pathways. These compounds may also be more effective than ROS scavengers, which frequently exhibit pro- as well as antioxidant activity. Compounds that exert cytotoxic effects by stimulating ROS will also be identified by this screen. Finally, combined with the budding yeast genomics tools (such as deletion strain collections) available for target identification, these compounds may provide useful tools for mapping pathways conserved in budding yeast that impact aging and age-related diseases in humans.  "," This is a phenotypic assay for detection of ROS inhibitors in a yeast model of senescence.  Solutions required per 384-well microtiter plate (for analysis of 320 compounds) include: 6.3 milliL SC medium, 1.8 milliL yeast (OD = 0.4) in SC medium, 0.2 milliL 3-AT control (15 milliM in media), 12 milliL 5 microM DHE in PBS with 0.1%BSA. In a divided reservoir plate (Phenix catalog # RR13027; columns 1, 2, 23, and 24 have individual reservoirs while 3-22 are have a shared reservoir) SC medium is added to the large center reservoir (22 milliL for 1 plate or 29 milliL for 2 plates, etc.) and to column 2, and the 3-AT to the column 1 reservoir (1.2 milliL). Columns 23 and 24 are left empty for use as wash stations. Using a 384-tip head on the Biomek FXp liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, USA), 17 microL is transfered to a 90 microL deep well 384-well plate (Greiner catalog # 784201). Using a 200 nanoL pin tool (V&P Scientific) on the Biomek FXp , the library compounds are transferred from the compound plate to the assay plate (final assay concentration is 10 microM).  Using a Nanoquot (BioTek, USA) liquid handler, 5 microL of  yeast solution is added to columns 1-22 of the assay plate. Assay plates are sealed with a breathable plastic membrane and incubated in a humidified (95%) incubator at 30 degrees C for 7 days. On the day the plate is read, a dilution plate is prepared by transferring 30 microL 5 milliM DHE in PBS with 0.1% BSA to every well in a 384-well 90 microL volume plate. Using the 384 tip head on the Biomek FXp, the assay plate contents are mixed to re-suspend yeast, then a volume of 3 microL is transferred to the dilution plate. Plates are analyzed by flow cytometry after 5-60 minutes using the HyperCyt [Edwards et al 2001] (IntelliCyt, USA) autosampler and the Cyan (Beckman Coulter, USA) flow cytometer using the 488 nanometer laser and the FL3 (PE-Texas Red, 613 nanometer) filter set.  Calculations: The flow cytometric data were analyzed utilizing HyperView (UNMCMD, developed by Bruce Edwards). This software automatically resolves data clusters of cells into 352 time bins, or wells with cells, per plate, and analyzes each bin to determine mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).  The data are exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet template, and the % Response is calculated for each well as follows: %Response = 100*SampleMean/AveSamples where SampleMean is the mean fluorescence intensity measured from a well with sample compound and AveSamples is the plate average of all the wells with sample compounds.  PUBCHEM_SCORE is calculated from the %Response: PUBCHEM_SCORE = 100 - %Response An Active compound has a %Response < 65 %, meaning PUBCHEM_SCORE > 35.  This cutoff corresponds to about three times the standard deviation of %Response from the entire screen of sample test compounds.

A normalized activity value of 100 is defined as (2)(NC).      A normalized activity value of -50 is defined as (0.5)(NC).      (PC wells were not used for normalization.)

Description:  Hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome (HCS) and 2p21 deletion syndrome are debilitating and poorly understood diseases, both involving deletion of the gene encoding prolyl oligopeptidase-like enzyme (PREPL), a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) family of serine peptidases [1]. Saghatelian and colleagues have developed an advanced LC-MS-based peptide metabolite profiling platform that allows linkage of enzymes with their endogenous substrates and establishment of their participation in specific biochemical networks; however, doing so requires selective chemical tools to functionally perturb the enzymes of interest [2]. They used this technology to annotate the uncharacterized enzyme KIAA1363 [3] and to identify a series of peptide substrates in the kidney for another POP family member, DPP4 [4]. Importantly, substrate identification for KIAA1363 was only accomplished through the application of a selective small molecule KIAA1363 inhibitor, as constitutive inhibition produced widespread metabolic disturbances [3]. Initial attempts at identifying the substrate specificity of PREPL have not been successful. Physicochemical properties of PREPL suggest that endogenous protein-protein interactions with PREPL might lead to an active form of PREPL that cannot be recapitulated in vitro. Therefore, the ability to target PREPL in vivo is a necessary step in understanding the function of this important peptidase enzyme. Development of selective inhibitors of PREPL would provide crucial tools to advance understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of this critical enzyme and might reveal new treatment possibilities for HCS and 2p21 deletion syndrome [5].

This is a competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) assay that uses fluorescence polarization to investigate enzyme- substrate functional interactions based on active site-directed molecular probes [5-7]. In the assay, a fluorophosphonate-polyethylene glycol-rhodamine (FP-PEG-Rh) probe that broadly targets enzymes from the serine hydrolase family is used to label PREPL in the presence of test compounds [8]. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). The assay is performed by incubating a library of compounds with PREPL for a defined period, adding the FP-PEG-Rh probe, and then reading fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as PREPL inhibitors will prevent PREPL-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 microliters of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 37.5 nanomolar of PREPL protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 375 nM FP-PEG-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 15 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 15 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP= ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing PREPL and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing PREPL in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no PREPL protein.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-11, for inactive 11-0.

Description:  Transcription factors are critical regulators of gene expression (1). Under conditions such as environmental stress and exposure to endogenous toxins, transcription factors can rapidly modulate the transcription of genes whose products regulate cell proliferation and metabolism. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix protein superfamily involved in the biological response to aromatic hydrocarbons, and regulates the expression of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450, aldehyde dehydrogenase, quinone reductase, and other phase I and phase II detoxification genes (2, 3). In response to various compounds, including the environmental pollutants dioxins, benzo(a)pyrene, dietary contaminants, grapefruit juice, endogenous toxins, and plant products such as carotinoids, nicotine and caffeine (2, 4-6), cytosolic AHR complexes with chaperones hsp90, p23, and XAP2, translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with the AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) to influence target gene transcription (7, 8). Gain-of-function studies in mice reveal the oncogenic potential of AHR (9), while other reports show roles for AHR in diverse biologic events such as organ development (10, 11), immune function and allergy (12), and estrogen responsiveness (13). The identification of agonists of AHR will provide useful tools to elucidate the roles of this receptor in cell metabolism, transcriptional control, and tumor formation.  References:  1.

Cells are incubated with test compounds for 24 hours, followed by cell lysis and detection of well luminescence using a commercially available luciferase reagent. As designed, compounds that act as AHR agonists will increase AHR activity and nuclear translocation, leading to increased activity of the DRE, increased transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, and increased well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.0 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  The HG2L6.1c3 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) α supplemented with 10% v/v premium fetal bovine serum, 400 micrograms/mL G418, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay 5000 cells in a 4 microliter volume of assay media (growth media as above except without geneticin) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 20 nL of test compound in DMSO (1.5 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or Indirubin (60 micromolar final concentration) to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C (5% CO2, 95% RH). After equilibrating the plates to room temperature for 30 minutes, the assay was stopped by dispensing 4microliters of SteadyLite HTS luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.  The percent activation for each compound was calculated using the following mathematical formula:  % Activation = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median__Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Indirubin.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-15, for inactive 15-0.

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, disease-associated mutations (1-4). Certain GPCRs are involved in signaling pathways for neuropeptides such as oxytocin, serotonin, and vasopressin, and influence complex social behaviors such as trust, anxiety, and parenting (5). Oxytocin receptor (OXTR: OTR) activity is mediated by G proteins (Gαq, Gαi, and Gβγ) which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (6, 7). OTR belongs to the class A (rhodopsin-like) GPCR family shared with the vasopressin receptors (8), and is expressed in the brain, uterus, and mammary glands. Studies showing a role for OTR in autism (9), defective lactation and nurturing behavior (10), and altered social behavior and aggression (10) suggest that the identification of small molecules that act as agonists of OTR activity may serve as useful tools in OTR biology and as potential therapeutic agents for human behavioral disorders.

In this counterscreen assay a CHO cell line stable transfected with V1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (such as Fluo-8), followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium. As designed, compounds that act as V1 activators will increase calcium mobilization, thereby increasing the relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.0 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-V1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 200 micrograms/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 microliters of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 microliters of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH; followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO, vasopressin (3 nM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and Vasopressin.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, for inactive 1-0.

Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) (APs) catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters, releasing inorganic phosphate and alcohol. APs are dimeric enzymes found in most organisms. In human, four isozymes of APs have been identified. One isozyme is tissue-nonspecific (designated TNAP) and three other isozymes are tissue-specific and named according to the tissue of their predominant expression: intestinal (IAP), placental (PLAP) and germ cell (GCAP) alkaline phosphatases. IAP expression is largely restricted to the gut, especially to the epithelial cells (enterocytes) of the small intestinal mucosa. The exact biological function of IAP is unknown.   The goal of this HTS is to identify novel and specific activators of mouse IAP. The only known to date class of alkaline phosphatases activators are hydroxyl-containing compounds, such as diethanolamine (DEA), that act as phosphoacceptor substrate and exhibit its effect in high-mM concentration range. Compounds with a similar mode of action are expected to demonstrate diminished stimulating potential if tested in the presence of high concentration of DEA. Therefore, for detection of compounds with diverse mode of action, the HTS campaign was performed in the presence close-to-Km DEA concentration.

While the biological implications of this inhibition are not known, these inhibitors have proven to be useful in the differential determination of AP isozymes as important diagnostic markers in many diseases. However, these known inhibitors of IAP are not entirely specific for IAP isozyme and have milllimolar affinity. In addition, they are common aminoacids that are ubiquitously present in the tissues and involved in diverse metabolic pathways, and therefore, are not appropriate tools for biological studies.

Reed, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego, CA  NLR family proteins are an important component of the innate immune system of vertebrates.  These proteins possess a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, called NACHT, in combination with variable numbers of Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domains that bind molecules produced by pathogens and probably also products of tissue injury. Among the effector mechanisms of NLR family proteins is activation of Caspase-1, which cleaves and activates pro-inflammatory cytokines. We present here a unique primary assay, in which we have reconstituted the mammalian Caspase mediated IL-1 activation pathway consisting of NLRP3 (NALP3), ASC, and Caspase-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The assay, conducted in liquid culture and formatted into microtiter plates, utilizes a cleavable chimeric transcription factor initially inserted into the cell membrane that upon specific proteolysis by activated Caspase-1 separates from the cell membrane and enters the nucleus to drive the expression of selectable marker genes and expression of b-galactosidase. Inhibition of any of the activities of the upstream components such as the oligimerization of NAPL3 and ASC to form a complex with Caspase-1 or the direct inhibition of the Caspase-1 will result in a positive phenotype.

Description:   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (A-beta; Abeta) in brain regions involved in memory and cognition (1). The steady-state levels of AB reflect a balance between its production via beta- and gamma-secretases and its catabolism by proteolytic degradation (2-4). Because Abeta cleavage products are less neurotoxic than intact Abeta, enzymes that cleave Abeta are of therapeutic interest for AD. In fact, upregulation of Abeta-degrading proteases can prevent AD-like pathology in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (5), suggesting that enhancing AB degradation may be therapeutic in human AD. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an Abeta-degrading zinc metalloprotease that requires a free thiol and bivalent cations to degrade extracellular Abeta in neurons and other cell types (6-8). The deduced sequence of IDE shares little homology to other proteinases, including cysteine, metallo-, serine, or aspartic proteases (9). Most IDE is localized inside the cell (10), where it can degrade internalized insulin (11), insulin-like growth factors I and II (12), and amylin (13), which make IDE an attractive target for type-2 diabetes. However, since IDE has also been found in the extracellular space and at the plasma membrane (6), it can function as a principal protease in Abeta catabolism (5, 14, 15). IDE secretion is not dependent upon the classical secretion pathway (16). Studies showing reduced IDE levels in human AD patients (17, 18), combined with increased brain AB levels in IDE-deficient mice (14, 15), and association studies suggesting that IDE variants may be associated with AD severity (19-23), suggest that the identification of compounds that selectively modulate IDE activity will present as important tools for the study of IDE function, AD, and diabetes.

This fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay (24) employs a derivatized Abeta- peptide [Fluorescein-Abeta-(1-40)-Lys-Biotin (FAbetaB)]. Cleavage of FAbetaB by IDE (provided by live HEK cells in the reaction) separates the Fluorescein moiety from the biotinylated moiety. Subsequent addition of avidin to the reaction increases the effective molecular weight of intact, biotinylated FAbetaB substrate, slowing their rotation rate and reducing the degree of depolarization of plane polarized light. In contrast, cleaved FAbetaB substrate species have their Fluorescein moiety separated from the rest of the molecule, which has a low molecular weight, hence rotating rapidly and causing strong depolarization. Thus, the relative amounts of cleaved and intact forms of the FAbetaB substrate can be measured. As designed, compounds that act as IDE inhibitors will inhibit FAbetaB cleavage, resulting in a population of large, avidin-bound, slowly rotating FAbetaB molecules. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5.59 uM.  Protocol Summary:  HEK cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Four uL of HEK cell suspension were then dispensed into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates (4,000 cells per well). Next, 45 nL of test compound in DMSO, low control (DMSO alone, 0.56% final concentration) or high control (60 uM of IDE reference inhibitor Ii1) were added to the appropriate wells.  The assay was started by dispensing 4 uL of 2X FAbetaB substrate solution (125 nM final) in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Plates were then incubated for 3.5 hours at 37 degrees Celsius, 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2. Next, 1 uL of 9X avidin solution (625 nM final) was added to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and fluorescence polarization was measured on a EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC dichroic mirror and a FITC FP filter set (excitation = 480 nm, emission = 540 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read using 30 flashes/well for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing reference IDE inhibitor Ii1.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. % Inhibition values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-8, and for inactive compounds 8-0.

In this case the results of each separate campaign were assigned ""Active/Inactive"" status based upon that campaign's specific compound activity cutoff value. All data reported were normalized on a per-plate basis. Possible artifacts of this assay can include, but are not limited to: dust or lint located in or on wells of the microtiter plate, and compounds that quench or emit fluorescence within the well.

Modification of proteins by SUMO is a dynamic and reversible process. SUMOylation/deSUMOylation cycle regulates SUMOs function. Sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) are involved in both the maturation of SUMO precursors (endopeptidase cleavage) and deconjugation of the targets (isopeptidase cleavage) [1-3]. There are seven SENPs (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) in humans, and several of these have been characterized as SUMO (or Nedd8) specific enzymes.

Description:   Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease association (1-4). Most non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain and regulate critical neuronal functions involved in feeding, sleep, mood, and addiction (5, 6). For example, in the later al hypothalamic region of the brain, two orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) derived from proteolytic processing of the same orexin precursor (7), signal through the Gq-coupled GPCRs OX1R and OX2R to stimulate food consumption (8, 9). OX1R binds orexin A selectively, while OX2R binds both orexin A and orexin B. Recently, signaling by orexin A through OX1R has been shown to play a critical role in cocaine-seeking behavior (10) and morphine withdrawal (6). Additional studies reveal OX1R involvement in behavioral plasticity (11), the sleep-wake cycle (12, 13), and gastric acid secretion (14), and that OX1R may bind other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and secretin (15). As a result, the identification of a selective OX1R antagonist would serve as a useful tool for exploring orexin biology, and the role of OX1R in drug addiction.  References:  1.

In this assay CHO cells stably transfected with the human OX1R receptor (CHO/OX1R cell line) are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 739 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day before the assay 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, 5% CO2, and 95% RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC77 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read and, I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-28, for inactive 62-0.

Reed, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego CA  Many cellular pathways leading to activation of NF-kB-family transcription factors have been identified to be participating in host-defense, immunity, inflammation, and cancer. Recently, a unique pathway activated by antigen receptors on T- and B-Lymphocytes has been revealed, involving a cascade of participating proteins that includes CARMA1 (BIMP3), Bcl-10, paracaspase (MALT1), TRAF6, and Ubc13. This pathway is initiated by Protein Kinase C-theta, which induces phosphorylation of components of this signaling pathway [1]. Based on experiments using siRNA and dominant-negative mutants, it has been determined that treatment of cells with the combination of phorbol ester PMA and the calcium-ionophore Ionomycin triggers this pathway, resulting in NF-kB activation [2-5]. Compounds able to block this stimulation will be useful research tools for analysis of the physiological roles of this NF-kB activation pathway.  This assay was originally assigned to the Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (TSRI MSC) by the NIH during the MLSCN pilot phase(""Primary HTS assay for chemical inhibitors of antigen receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation"", AID 465.)   In the original MLSCN screen a stably transfected reporter epithelial cell line (HEK293) that contains a luciferase gene driven by a NF-kB responsive promoter was used for compound library screening.  The hits identified from that screen were very much less potent when tested in T cell lines.  Therefore, in this rescreening paradigm, the primary screen will be accomplished using an NF-kB-luciferase reporter cloned into a T-cell line (Jurkat). The goal therefore is to identify compounds that selectively inhibit one of the several known pathways that lead to NF-kB activation in mammalian cells in a T-cell specific manner.

In the primary assay, INS1E cells are treated with 3 cytokines (Interferon-gamma, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and Interleukin 1-beta) and compounds for 48 hours. The combination of cytokines leads to apoptotic cell death.  The level of cell death is inferred my measuring overall ATP levels with Promega's Cell Titer Glo.  Expected Outcome: Cytokine induced apoptosis leads to cell death and thus, reduced ATP levels.  Candidate compounds will prevent cell death and keep ATP levels elevated.  ATP is measured with Cell Titer go (Promega) and so increased values are expected.

Active compounds result in increased readout signal.  The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Stimulators Minus Neutral Controls' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3):      The median raw signal of the intraplate NC wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0.      The median raw signal of the intraplate PC wells was set to a normalized activity value of 100. Experimental wells were scaled to this range, giving an activity score as percent change in signal relative to the intraplate controls.

Description:   Helicobacter pylori infects approximately half of the world's population and is responsible for inducing chronic gastric inflammation that can progress to gastric cancer (1). At the cellular level, Helicobacter pylori infection of the human stomach is associated with inflammation that elicits DNA damage in both bacterial and host cells (2). This DNA damage must be repaired in order for the bacteria to persist. The H. pylori AddAB helicase-exonuclease is required for DNA repair and efficient stomach colonization (3), and inhibitors of this enzyme may be useful antibacterial drugs for treating these infections. The AddAB class of enzymes is closely related to the RecBCD class of helicase-nucleases; both classes are widely distributed in bacteria but appear to be absent in eukaryotes (4). The protein complex functions in DNA repair by directing free DNA ends into the homologous recombination pathway (5). As a result, the identification of inhibitors of AddAB may be useful tools for elucidating the role of AddAB and RecBCD in bacterial recombination and as potential novel antibiotics with few off-target effects.

This bacterial cell-based assay employs E. coli that express the Helicobacter pylori AddAB+ genes. The bacteria are infected with a mutant T4 bacteriophage that carries three nonsense mutations in gene 2, whose protein product normally protects viral DNA from AddAB-mediated degradation after infection. The mutant phage infects and blocks the growth of V3069 E. coli, which lack AddAB nuclease activity (AddAB-). The mutant phage also infect V3065 E. coli, which contain a plasmid expressing the H. pylori addAB+ genes , but V3065 proliferate because of the AddAB directed nuclease and helicase activity against the unprotected mutant phage. In this assay, the V3065 E. coli cells are infected with mutant T4 phage in the presence of test compounds, followed by measurement of well optical density as an indicator of bacterial growth. As designed, compounds that inhibit AddAB will allow the virus to replicate and inhibit bacterial growth, leading to reduced well absorbance. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal test concentration of 11.86 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, V3065 and V3069 bacterial cultures were grown at 37 C until it reached an OD600 of 0.05 or 2.5e07 cfu/mL. To start the assay, 3 uL of Assay Buffer (0.1% Glycerol + 100 ug/mL Ampicillin + Cation Mueller Hinton Broth) was dispensed into all wells. Next, 60 nL of test compound in DMSO, Ciprofloxacin (0.95 ug/ml final concentration) or DMSO alone (1.2% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. Then, 1 uL of V3065 (addAB+) or V3069 (phage control) bacterial cultures were dispensed into the appropriate wells and plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C.  Next, 1 uL of mutant T4 2 149 bacteriophage was dispensed to the appropriate wells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02. Plates were centrifuged and after 18 hours of incubation at 37 C, absorbance (OD600) was read on a Envision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using 10 flashes per well.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing V3065 + Ciprofloxacin + phage. Low_Control is defined as wells containing V3065 + DMSO + phage. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing V3065 in the presence of test compound + phage  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-9, and for inactive compounds 9-0.

Description:   Helicobacter pylori infects approximately half of the world's population and is responsible for inducing chronic gastric inflammation that can progress to gastric cancer (1). At the cellular level, Helicobacter pylori infection of the human stomach is associated with inflammation that elicits DNA damage in both bacterial and host cells (2). This DNA damage must be repaired in order for the bacteria to persist. The H. pylori AddAB helicase-exonuclease is required for DNA repair and efficient stomach colonization (3), and inhibitors of this enzyme may be useful antibacterial drugs for treating these infections. The AddAB class of enzymes is closely related to the RecBCD class of helicase-nucleases; both classes are widely distributed in bacteria but appear to be absent in eukaryotes (4).

Diverse disease states ranging from diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, to hemophilia and lysosomal storage diseases have all been characterized by folding defects or impaired transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Very recently it has come to light that deregulation of protein synthesis may be a key component in the pathogenesis of cancer and metastasis. When misfolded protein accumulates in the ER lumen, the cell activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to clear the malfolded proteins and restore homeostatic protein processing. When a stress is prolonged or robust the UPR employs a genetic pathway that results in cell death. The proposed studies are to focus attention to identify and characterize drug-like small molecule activators of the apoptotic pathway We will investigate the hypotheses that specific and robust activation of the PERK-eIF2a-CHOP (apoptotic) arm will exacerbate the UPR and lead to cell death in malignant cells with hyper-active secretory machinery. This aim is predicated on the hypothesis that the adaptive arm of the UPR can be pharmacologically overwhelmed and lead to a productive CHOP-mediated apoptotic response in human cancer cells.  For this primary screen, a cell-based assay was utilized using a cell line stably transfected to report on the PERK-elF2a-CHOP pathway via a luciferase-based reporter system. Activation of the CHOP-mediated apoptotic response leads to the activation of luciferase expression which can be quantified via luminescence. ","UPR CHO-CHOP 1536-Well Assay Protocol A.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay demonstrated by a compound at 10 uM concentration: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21. 2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay 3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",,,,,uHTS identification of small molecule activators of the apoptotic arm of the Unfolded Protein response via a luminescent-based reporter assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A399-UPR-CHOP-PrimaryAgonist-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-07-22,,331760,1125,330635,331671,1124,330547,1.3,Live,,,,cell-based format,reporter-gene assay,luminescence method

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease association (1-4). Most non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain and regulate critical neuronal functions involved in feeding, sleep, mood, and addiction (5, 6). For example, in the later al hypothalamic region of the brain, two orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) derived from proteolytic processing of the same orexin precursor (7), signal through the Gq-coupled GPCRs OX1R and OX2R to stimulate food consumption (8, 9). OX1R binds orexin A selectively, while OX2R binds both orexin A and orexin B. Recently, signaling by orexin A through OX1R has been shown to play a critical role in cocaine-seeking behavior (10) and morphine withdrawal (6). Additional studies reveal OX1R involvement in behavioral plasticity (11), the sleep-wake cycle (12, 13), and gastric acid secretion (14), and that OX1R may bind other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and secretin (15). As a result, the identification of a selective OX1R antagonist would serve as a useful tool for exploring orexin biology, and the role of OX1R in drug addiction.  References:  1.

In this assay, the parental CHO cell line (not transfected with any GPCRs) is used to monitor inhibition of Gq activity by test compound. Cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular calcium as monitored by the FLUO-8 fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye. As designed, compounds that act as Gq antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and thus decreased well fluorescence. These compounds are considered nonselective Gq inhibitors. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day before the assay, 2000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture with 1 mM trypan red plus (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The assay was started after an additional 30 minute incubation at room temperature, by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 6 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Next, 15 nL of ATP in DMSO (EC84 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 94 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 100 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  % Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP Challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO alone (no ATP).  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-22, and for inactive compounds 61-0.

Bahnson, University of Delaware External Assay ID: PPAFAH_INH_FP_1536_1X%INH PRUN  Name: Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the plasma platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (pPAFAH).  Description:  Atherosclerosis is a process in which plaques, deposits of low density lipoproteins (LDL), lipid-laden macrophages and other inflammatory cells, calcium, and cellular debris - build up in the inner lining of an artery. These plaques interfere with blood flow, damage the arterial wall, and eventually rupture, causing debris to migrate downstream, leading to myocardial infarction or stroke (1-4). Human platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (pPAFAH) is a Ca2+ independent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) identified in human plasma as the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis/inactivation of platelet activating factor (PAF) (5, 6), a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid signaling molecule (7). PAFAH catalyses the hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone of PAF converting it to lyso-PAF (8-9). PAFAH has a catalytic cysteine residue and is consequently sensitive to broadly reactive thiol alkylating agents, including N-ethylmaleimide (10); however, selective inhibitors for PAFAH have not yet been identified. Inhibiting PAFAH may thus offer a new therapeutic strategy for cancer. Development of a selective inhibitor would also aid in the investigation into PAFAH involvement in the dysregulated biochemical pathways that support tumorigenesis. As a result, the identification of inhibitors of PAFAH would help to elucidate the physiological role of this enzyme and its contribution to atherosclerosis, cancer, and other inflammatory pathologies (11).

In this biochemical assay, recombinant pPAFAH protein is incubated with test compounds and a Rh-conjugated activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. The assay is performed by incubating test compounds with pPAFAH for a defined period, followed by addition of the FP-rhodamine probe and measurement of fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as pPAFAH inhibitors will prevent pPAFAH-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.39 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 uL of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 12.5 nM of pPAFAH protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 17 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.34% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 15 minutes of incubation at 25 C, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525 nm, emission = 598 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 15 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing pPAFAH and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing pPAFAH in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no pPAFAH protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Diverse disease states ranging from diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, to hemophilia and lysosomal storage diseases have all been characterized by folding defects or impaired transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Very recently it has come to light that deregulation of protein synthesis may be a key component in the pathogenesis of cancer and metastasis. When misfolded protein accumulates in the ER lumen, the cell activates the adaptive arm of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to clear the malfolded proteins and restore homeostatic protein processing. When a stress is prolonged or robust the UPR employs a genetic pathway that results in cell death. The proposed studies are to focus attention to identify and characterize drug-like small molecule activators of the adaptive pathway. We will investigate the hypotheses that activation of the IRE1-XBP1 (adaptive) arm will facilitate a prolonged recovery opportunity in pathologies where cells are burdened with an accumulation of mis-folded or poorly secreted proteins.  For this primary screen, a cell-based assay was utilized using a cell line stably transfected to report on the IRE1-XBP1 pathway via a luciferase-based reporter system. Activation of the IRE1-XBP1-mediated adaptive response leads to the activation of luciferase expression which can be quantified via luminescence. ","UPR CHO-XBP1 1536-Well Assay Protocol A.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay demonstrated by a compound at 20 uM concentration: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21. 2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay 3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",,,,,uHTS identification of small molecule activators of the adaptive arm of the Unfolded Protein response via a luminescent-based reporter assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A405-UPR-XBP1-PrimaryAgonist-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-08-18,,331760,1101,330659,331671,1099,330572,1.2,Live,,,,cell-based format,process assay,luminescence method

The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are a key family of modulators and scaffolds for GPCRs which have been identified by many authors as appealing drug targets [1-5]. RGS proteins bind to activated G proteins and strongly inhibit their signals by catalyzing the hydrolysis of bound GTP [6-7]. Consistent with this mode of action, genetic deletion of RGS greatly enhances receptor signaling [8-10]. Furthermore, RGS proteins display isoform-specific tissue distribution [11-14] and their expression is altered in pathophysiological states including Parkinson's disease [15], neuropathic pain [16-17], schizophrenia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure [18]. An activator of RGS action would be expected to suppress the function of GPCR agonists such as vasoactivators, inflammatory mediators, endogenous neurotransmitters, or catecholamines such as L-DOPA. It has recently been established that loss of function of RGS2 causes hypertensive symptoms in mice [19] and may contribute to vasoactive disorders in humans as well [20-22]. Also, reduced expression of RGS4 has been correlated with schizophrenia [23-24]. Consequently, compounds that could either enhance the function of RGS proteins or could increase their expression might be of therapeutic benefit. The identification of selective modulators of RGS proteins would also greatly facilitate experimental studies of this sizeable protein family (with 20-30 members) by permitting rapid and specific chemical potentiation. Such RGS modulators would be particularly useful to determine which RGS proteins modulate particular receptor signaling pathways.  The goal of this project is to identify potentiators /activators of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), using a receptor-stimulated cell-based Ca++ assay.  References: [1].

RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that do not show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered as activator/potentiator hits. M3 receptor and other endogenous receptor activators/potentiators will be excluded through later counter-screening against non-induced parental cells.  Protocol for RGS4 Primary Screen: 1.

Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep. Include 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul /well of 2uM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 ul/well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT. 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11.  After 100 seconds, add 4 ul of ECmax (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z' factors [26] 14. Calculate B scores [27] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12 15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is less than 4 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds above the mean (B score Activator Ratio<mean-4*SD), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation plus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an activator of RGS4.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1).  16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of Int(((Log(ABS(B score ratio))-0.82)/0.44)*100), and they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B score ratio), B score ratio, as in the result definition.

Description:  Cancer progression depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) machinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although apoptosis induction using chemotherapeutics is a common anti-cancer treatment, cancer cells often survive because of defects in the pro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). The main effector proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway are the cysteine-aspartic acid proteases (caspases). Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme (3,4). Caspase 3 is a major executioner enzyme, and is responsible for proteolysis of hundreds of cellular substrates, including caspases 6, 7 and 9. Procaspase 3 itself is processed by caspases 8, 9 and 10. Studies demonstrating that most mutations in which upstream proapoptotic signals are improperly transmitted to activate executioner caspases lead to cancers and that levels of procaspase 3 protein are elevated in certain cancers (5, 6), suggest that procaspase 3 may play a role in resistance to chemotherapy. As a result, the identification of procaspase 3 activators may identify molecular mechanisms of apoptosis-resistant cancers, and elucidate the role of procaspase 3 activation in tumorigenesis (7).

This assay employs a procaspase 3 mutant enzyme, D9A/D28A/D175A (called PC-3 D3A) which is unable to autoproteolyze itself because its aspartic acid cleavage sites have been mutated to alanines. The mutant has a fully functional active site that can process the peptidic Ac-DEVD-pNA chromogenic substrate. Cleavage of substrate by procaspase 3 hydrolyzes the bond between the aspartic acid and p-nitroaniline, leading to release of yellow p-nitroaniline and an increase in well absorbance at 405 nm. In this assay, PC-3 D3A enzyme is pre-incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of substrate and measurement of well epi-absorbance. As designed, compounds that activate procaspase 3 activity will increase substrate hydrolysis, leading to an increase in well absorbance. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 8.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 uL of zinc-free Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton-X 100) containing 2 uM of PC-3 D3A protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 43 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 hour at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 uL of 400 uM Ac-DEVD-pNA in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 2 hours of incubation at 25 C, epi-absorbance was read on the EnVision plate reader using a photometric filter set (excitation = 405 nm, emission = 450 nm) and a dichroic mirror with 425 nm cutoff. Fluorescence emission was read at 10 flashes per well at two time points (0 minutes and 120 minutes).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate absorbance:  Abs = ( -Log10( ( [ Raw2 ] / [ Mean Reference2 ] ) ) - ( -Log10 ( ( [ Raw1 ] ) / [ Mean Reference ] ) )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the read at T0 minutes.  Raw2 is defined as the read at T120 minutes. Mean Reference is defined as a mean of values from wells containing buffer only at T0. Mean Reference2 is defined as a mean of values from wells containing buffer only at T120.  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 5 uM PC-3 D3A.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation.The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.   PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-9, and for inactive compounds 9-0.

The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) are a key family of modulators and scaffolds for GPCRs which have been identified by many authors as appealing drug targets [1-5]. RGS proteins bind to activated G proteins and strongly inhibit their signals by catalyzing the hydrolysis of bound GTP [6-7]. Consistent with this mode of action, genetic deletion of RGS greatly enhances receptor signaling [8-10]. Furthermore, RGS proteins display isoform-specific tissue distribution [11-14] and their expression is altered in pathophysiological states including Parkinson's disease [15], neuropathic pain [16-17], schizophrenia, hypertension, and congestive heart failure [18]. An activator of RGS action would be expected to suppress the function of GPCR agonists such as vasoactivators, inflammatory mediators, endogenous neurotransmitters, or catecholamines such as L-DOPA. It has recently been established that loss of function of RGS2 causes hypertensive symptoms in mice [19] and may contribute to vasoactive disorders in humans as well [20-22]. Also, reduced expression of RGS4 has been correlated with schizophrenia [23-24]. Consequently, compounds that could either enhance the function of RGS proteins or could increase their expression might be of therapeutic benefit. The identification of selective modulators of RGS proteins would also greatly facilitate experimental studies of this sizeable protein family (with 20-30 members) by permitting rapid and specific chemical potentiation. Such RGS modulators would be particularly useful to determine which RGS proteins modulate particular receptor signaling pathways.  The goal of this project is to identify inhibitors of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), using a  receptor-stimulated cell-based Ca++ assay.  References: [1].

RGS4 function is monitored by calcium flux with a commercially available Fluo4-AM dye. Compounds that show increase in the Fluo4 fluorescence in induced RGS4 expressed cells are considered agonist hits. M3 receptor and other endogenous receptor inhibitors will be excluded through later counter-screening against non-induced parental cells.  Protocol for RGS4 Primary Screen: 1. Cell culture: Cells (HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4) are routinely cultured in DMEM (high glucose, w/ glutamine), 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep, 15 ug/ml Blasticidin, 400 ug/ml G418, 200 ug/ml Hygromycin. 2. Cell plating: Add 50 ul/well of 200,000 cells/ml re-suspended in DMEM/high glucose medium with 10% FBS, 1%Pen/Strep. Include 10 ng/ml Doxycyclin (DOX) to induce RGS4 expression. 3. Incubate overnight at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2. 4. Remove medium and add 20 ul /well of 2 uM Fluo4-AM solution to cells. 5. Incubate 30 minutes at 37 degrees C in incubator. 6. Prepare 6x compound plates and control plates on Cybi-Well system: test compounds are prepared using assay buffer (HBSS-HEPES pH 7.4). 7. Remove Fluo4-AM dye solution and add 20 ul /well of assay buffer to cells. 8. Incubate 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). 9. Add 6x compounds in cell plates and incubate 20 minutes at RT. 9. Load cell plates on Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader 10. Measure fluorescence for 10 seconds at 1Hz to establish baseline 11. Add 4 ul of 7x EC20 (carbachol) into the cell plates and record fluorescence for 100 seconds. 12. Calculate ratio readout as F(max-min)/F0 and integrated ratio readout. 13. Calculate the average and standard deviation for negative and positive controls in each plate, as well as Z and Z prime factors [26] 14. Calculate B scores [27] for test compounds using integrated ratios calculated in Step 12 15. Outcome assignment: If the B score of the test compound is more than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the B scores of integrated ratios of all library compounds above the mean (B score ratio>3*SD+mean), AND the ratio of initial fluorescence intensity is within 5 times the standard deviation plus or minus the mean of the ratios of the library compounds, the compound is designated in the Outcome as active (value=2) as an inhibitor of RGS4.  Otherwise, it is designated as inactive (value=1).  16. Score assignment: An active test compound is assigned a score between 5 and 100 by calculation of Int(((Log(ABS(B score ratio))-0.6)/1.25)*100), they are normalized to the smallest and largest LOG(B score ratio), B score ratio, as in the result definition.  The inactive test compounds are assigned a score of 0.  List of reagents  1. HEK293-FlpIn-TREx/M3R/RGS4 cell lines (provided by assay provider) 2. PBS: pH7.4 (Invitrogen Catalog number 10010049) 3.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary and single-concentration confirmation screening data.  a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30. This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",TPA: protein transporter TIM10,,,,uHTS identification of small molecule inhibitors of tim10 yeast via a luminescent assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A415-tim10-Primary-Antagonist-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-09-03,,331760,4615,327145,331671,4615,327058,1.2,Live,organism-based format,viability assay,bioluminescence,,,

Description:  Cancer progression depends upon evasion of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) machinery that normally kills an unneeded or rogue cell (1). Although apoptosis induction using chemotherapeutics is a common anti-cancer treatment, cancer cells often survive because of defects in the pro-apoptotic proteins activated by these drugs (2). The main effector proteins involved in the apoptosis pathway are the cysteine-aspartic acid proteases (caspases). Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme (3,4). Caspase 3 is a major executioner enzyme, and is responsible for proteolysis of hundreds of cellular substrates, including caspases 6, 7 and 9. Procaspase 3 itself is processed by caspases 8, 9 and 10. Studies demonstrating that most mutations in which upstream proapoptotic signals are improperly transmitted to activate executioner caspases lead to cancers and that levels of procaspase 3 protein are elevated in certain cancers (5, 6), suggest that procaspase 3 may play a role in resistance to chemotherapy. As a result, the identification of procaspase 3 activators may identify molecular mechanisms of apoptosis-resistant cancers, and elucidate the role of procaspase 3 activation in tumorigenesis (7).

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for procaspase-3 activators. This assay employs a procaspase-7 triple-mutant enzyme (D23A/D198A/D206A) (PC-7 D3A) which is unable to autoproteolyze itself because its aspartic acid cleavage sites have been mutated to alanines. The mutant has a fully functional active site that can process the peptidic Ac-DEVD-pNA chromogenic substrate. Cleavage of this substrate by procaspase-7 hydrolyzes the bond between the aspartic acid and p-nitroaniline, leading to release of yellow p-nitroaniline and an increase in well absorbance at 405 nm. In this assay, the enzyme is pre-incubated with test compounds, followed by addition of substrate and measurement of well epi-absorbance. As designed, compounds that activate procaspase-7 activity will increase substrate hydrolysis, leading to an increase in well absorbance. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 8.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 uL of zinc-free Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton-X 100) containing 2 uM of PC-7 D3A protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 43 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 1 hour at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 2.5 uL of 400 uM Ac-DEVD-pNA in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 2 hours of incubation at 25 C, epi-absorbance was read on the EnVision plate reader using a photometric filter set (excitation = 405 nm, emission = 450 nm) and a dichroic mirror with the 425 nm cutoff. Fluorescence emission was read at 10 flashes per well at two time points (0 minutes and 120 minutes).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate absorbance:  Absorbance = ( -Log10 * ( [Raw2] / [Mean Reference2] ) ) - ( -Log10 * ( [Raw1] / [Mean Reference] ) )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the read at T0 minutes. Raw2 is defined as the read at T120 minutes. Mean Reference is defined as a mean of values from wells containing buffer only at T0. Mean Reference2 is defined as a mean of values from wells containing buffer only at T120.  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 5 uM PC-7.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-14, and for inactive compounds 14-0.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary and single-concentration confirmation screening data.  a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30. This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",TPA: protein transporter TIM23,,,,uHTS identification of small molecule inhibitors of tim23-1 yeast via a luminescent assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A419-tim23-1-Primary-Antagonist-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-09-07,,331760,4406,327354,331671,4405,327268,1.1,Live,organism-based format,viability assay,bioluminescence,,,

Description:   Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease association (1-4). Most non-sensory GPCRs are expressed in the brain and regulate critical neuronal functions involved in feeding, sleep, mood, and addiction (5, 6). For example, in the lateral hypothalamic region of the brain, two orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) derived from proteolytic processing of the same orexin precursor (7), signal through the Gq-coupled GPCRs OX1R and OX2R to stimulate food consumption (8, 9). OX1R binds orexin A selectively, while OX2R binds both orexin A and orexin B. Recently, signaling by orexin A through OX1R has been shown to play a critical role in cocaine-seeking behavior (10) and morphine withdrawal (6). Additional studies reveal OX1R involvement in behavioral plasticity (11), the sleep-wake cycle (12, 13), and gastric acid secretion (14), and that OX1R may bind other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y and secretin (15). As a result, the identification of a selective OX1R antagonist would serve as a useful tool for exploring orexin biology, and the role of OX1R in drug addiction.  References:  1.

This assay employs the IP-One competitive immunoassay kit (Cisbio International) and CHO cells that stably express the Gq-coupled human receptor OX1R/Hcrtr1 (CHO-OX1R). This receptor signals through phospholipase C (PLC) to trigger the inositol phosphate (IP) cascade and IP1 production. Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody and D2-labeled IP1 are included for HTRF-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, CHO-OX1R cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled IP1 antibody, and D2-IP1. Binding of the labeled IP1 antibody to D2-IP1 causes energy transfer from the antibody to the D2-IP1 molecule, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated OX1R activation stimulates endogenous cellular IP1 production by the cells, which competes with the labeled IP1 for binding to the labeled IP1-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as OX1R/Hcrtr1 antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular IP1 production, reduce levels of IP1 available to compete with labeled D2-IP1, leading to increased interactions between D2-IP1 and the labeled anti-IP1 antibody, resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 6.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO/OX1R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH) up to a confluency of approximately 30 million cells per flask. The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 350 ug/mL Geneticin, , and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day of the assay, 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO and antagonist controls in DMSO were added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Next, 15 nL of Orexin-A agonist in DMSO (EC80 average response), or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, 1 uL of D2-labeled IP1 (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well and centrifuged for 30 seconds. Next, 1 uL of Cryptate-labeled anti-IP1 antibody (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well, centrifuged for 30 seconds and plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 618 nm (with 4 nm bandwith) for Cryptate and 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth) for D2-IP1, using the ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).  For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I671nm / I618nm  Where:  I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671nm. I618nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 618nm.  Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  % Inhibition = ( 1 -( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Orexin A peptide challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing the antagonist SB-334867-A.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-9, and for inactive compounds 36-0.

Description:   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disorder that affects about one percent of the US population (1). Existing therapies treat the symptoms of the disease but not the underlying cause, and are associated with numerous side effects (2). The activity of Protein Arginine Deiminase 4 (PAD4), one of four known active PAD isozymes, is increased in RA; where it is thought to generate a subset of antigens that the immune system recognizes as foreign (3). Genetic, serological, and biochemical evidence suggests that dysregulated PAD4, and potentially PAD2, activities play a role in both the onset and progression of RA (1). Cl-amidine, a compound that specifically inactivates PAD4, reduces disease severity and incidence in the collagen-induced model of arthritis (CIA) (unpublished observations). However, because Cl-amidine inhibits all of the PAD isozymes with equipotency, it is unclear whether the observed reduction in disease severity is due to the inhibition of single or multiple PADs. This is particularly relevant because both PAD 2 and 4 are overexpressed in the joints of patients with RA (4). Thus, the identification of PAD selective inhibitors would facilitate the characterization of their individual contributions to the onset and progression of RA and represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for RA.

In this biochemical assay, PAD4 is labeled in an active site-directed manner by the fluorescent ABPP probe rhodamine-conjugated Cl-amidine (RCA) in the presence of test compounds. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. The assay is performed by incubating test compounds with PAD4 for a defined period, followed by addition of the rhodamine-conjugated Cl-amidine probe and measurement of fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as PAD4 inhibitors will prevent PAD4-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization in the well. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.36 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.01% Pluronic F-127, and 1 mM TCEP) containing 1.25 uM of PAD4 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 32 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.64% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 375 nM RCA probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 20 hours at 37 C. Prior to reading, plates were equilibrated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Fluorescence polarization was read on Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525 nm, emission = 598 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 30 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 *( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing PAD4, RCA and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing PAD4 in the presence of test compound and RCA. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, RCA but, no PAD4 protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Reed, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego CA  Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factors (TRAFs) are a family of adapter proteins that bind an unusual ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13, which produces polyubiquitin chains linked at lysine 63 of ubiquitin. These lysine 63-linked ubiquitin polymers trigger changes in protein activity. Ubiquitination by Ubc13 of TRAFs and the various protein kinases to which TRAFs bind is recognized as a critical step in signaling by TNFRs, TLRs, NLRs, and T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors (TCR/BCR) during innate and acquired immune responses. Since aberrant signaling by these receptor systems is linked to a wide variety of autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases; compounds that neutralize Ubc13 may prove useful as a novel type of immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agent.   The goal of this screen is to measure the biochemical activity of Ubc13 in vitro, based on the principal of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET).  Ubiquitination reactions contain purified recombinant proteins (E1, Ubc13 and Uev1a) mixed with labeled ubiquitins (terbium- and fluorescein-labeled) and ATP-regenerating system to trigger polyubiquitin chain synthesis in vitro.  The reaction product is mixed chains of terbium-(fluorescence donor) and fluorescein-(fluorescene acceptor) conjugated Ubiquitin, thus creating the basis for robust TR-FRET signals.   REFERENCES 1.

Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary and single-concentration confirmation screening data.  a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c.

If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30. This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N,,,,uHTS identification of UBC13 Polyubiquitin Inhibitors via a TR-FRET Assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A429-UBC13-Primary-TR-FRET-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-09-24,,330481,1540,328071,330393,1538,327986,2.1,Live,protein complex format,ubiquitination assay,homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence,,,

Treatment of patients with fungal infections is severely hampered by the development of antifungal drug resistance [Cannon, et al 2009]. The goal of this project is to address this health need by discovering novel chemical compounds that reverse antifungal drug resistance by inhibiting the drug efflux pump molecules in the fungal cell membrane, overexpression of which is the major cause of resistance in clinical isolates of most Candida species [Niimi, et al. 2004].    Utilizing a a panel of yeast strains expressing efflux pumps from the following clinically relevant fungi: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei [Lamping and Cannon, 2010], this approach analyzes three 'sentinel' strains in a phenotypic HTS which measures efflux of the fluorescent pump substrate Nile Red. Follow-up analysis on confirmed HTS hits will be conducted in single-plex assays using each strain individually to identify the target detected in the primary HTS.    ","Yeast cultures (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AD1-8u background), expressing efflux pumps from Candida albicans, namely AD/CaCDR1; AD/CaCDR2 and AD/CaMDR1, and the control strain containing the empty pABC3 cassette without a heterologous efflux pump gene, AD/pABC3, (all supplied by the assay provider) are incubated at 30 degrees C with shaking (250 rpm) until an optical density (OD 600) of 1.5 to 2.0 is obtained.  All cultures are adjusted to be at an equivalent OD of 0.6.  The cells are collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS, then re-suspended as a tri-plex mixture in PBS with 10 microM Nile Red (Invitrogen USA).  The mixture is placed at 4 degrees C to equilibrate with efflux pumps effectively turned off. Wells containing 5 microL of PBS with 2 percent glucose and 20 microM compound are plated during this time. Enniatin B is used as an on-plate positive control at 25 microM. Vector (AD/pABC3, stained in the same protocol as the tri-plex) is used as an off-plate control. The compound/buffer wells receive 5 microL of stained tri-plex mixture. In-well reagent summary: 5 microM Nile Red, 10 microM compound, 1 percent glucose. The assay plate is incubated inverted 30 degrees C for 1 hr. Accumulation of Nile Red is measured by sample delivery via HyperCyt (IntelliCyt, USA) to a Cyan (Beckman Coulter, USA) flow cytometer. Samples are excited with a 488 nm laser and a PE-Texas Red filter is used to detect the fluorescence signal from the Nile Red substrate.    Calculation: The data are exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet template, and the PERCENT_RESPONSE is calculated for each well as follows:  PERCENT_RESPONSE = 100((MFItest-MFIneg.control)/(MFIpos.control-MFIneg.control)) where MFI is median fluorescence intensity of cells with test compounds, positive or negative control wells.  ZPRIME =1-((3*StDev(+Cntrl)+3*StDev(-Cntrl))/(Mean(+Cntrl)-Mean(-Cntrl)))  RAW_MEDIAN = median fluorescence intensity of cells per well  PLATE_CUTOFF = Mean(RAW_MEDIAN) + 4 * (StDev(RAW_MEDIAN)) where mean and StDev are computed per plate.  There are two ways for a compound to be considered active, first if (ZPRIME > 0.3 OR CV < 0.1) AND the PERCENT_RESPONSE > 5.15%, then compound is ACTIVE. A compound that fails this first test is compared relative to its plate. If (ZPRIME > 0.3 OR CV < 0.1) AND RAW_MEDIAN > PLATE_CUTOFF, then compound is ACTIVE.  The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE is determined as follows: If compound is ACTIVE then PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = 50 + PERCENT_RESPONSE, otherwise PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE = PERCENT_RESPONSE. PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 2 (or ACTIVE) if PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE > 50, otherwise the PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME = 1 (or INACTIVE).  The 5.15% cutoff corresponds to about three times the standard deviation of PERCENT_RESPONSE  from 'non-fluorescent' test compounds.  Negative PERCENT_RESPONSE is primarily due to test compounds with innate fluorescence.",,,,,,Phenotypic HTS multiplex for antifungal efflux pump inhibitors,NMMLSC,UNM_CMD_phenotypic_multiplex_HTS_for_antifungal efflux_pump_inhibitors,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2010-09-27,,329010,1437,327573,328897,1437,327463,1.3,Live,,,,cell-based format,transporter assay,flow cytometry

Wahl, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA  A wild type but attenuated p53 is retained in approximately 50% of human tumors, and reactivation of p53 in such tumors is an attractive chemotherapeutic strategy. p53 activity is restricted in vivo by mdm2 and mdmx, and knockout of either of these proteins is embryonic lethal in a p53-dependent manner (1, 2). Both proteins bind to p53 via a hydrophobic N-terminal pocket and block p53-dependent transcription of genes required for tumor suppression. Efforts to reactivate p53 with small molecules have focused on inhibition of the mdm2/p53 interaction, which leads to increased p53 levels and activity. However, recent reports indicate that targeting the mdm2/p53 interaction alone is insufficient to induce apoptosis in some cancer cell lines, particularly in the presence of high levels of mdmx (3-5). The most potent mdm2 antagonists do not effectively block mdmx, due to subtle structural alterations of the mdmx hydrophobic pocket (6). Since mdmx is overexpressed in many human tumors with wild type p53, this presents a barrier to effective p53 activation - additional strategies to antagonize mdm2 and mdmx are warranted.  Mdm2 is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family of proteins, which facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin (Ub) molecules from E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes to target substrates (7, 8). This in turn targets the substrate for proteasome-dependent degradation. The C-terminal RING domain of mdm2 is required for ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (7). Although mdmx also has a RING domain, it has no intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity (9). However, mdm2 and mdmx can homo- or heterodimerize via their RING domains, with a heterodimer being the more stable complex (10, 11). The RING/RING heterodimerization is thought to create an optimal scaffold for positioning and/or processivity of the E2 Ub conjugating enzyme. Therefore, identification of small molecules that disrupt the mdm2/mdmx interaction will provide an additional strategy for p53 reactivation. Development of a small molecule inhibitor of the mdm2/mdmx interaction will permit reversible inactivation of endogenous complexes, thus making analysis of p53 pathway more tractable. The aims of this proposal will be to identify a novel class of p53 activating compounds.  This reporter cell-based assay is based on bimolecular luciferase-based complementation (12-14), which relies on the reconstitution of the luciferase activity from two fragments of the enzyme. Corresponding halves of the luciferase cDNA are fused to the RING domains of Mdm2 and MdmX proteins, resulting in luciferase activity only if the two RING domains interact. The constructs are expressed from a bidirectional doxycycline-inducible promoter, affording precise control over the timing and expression level of Luc-RING fusions.  References: 1.

Jacob Strouse, Mark Carter, Cristian Bologa, Gergely Zahoransky-Kohalmi   Screening Cener PI:  Larry Sklar UNMCMD Chemistry Center PI:  Craig Lindsley Vanderbilt Specialized Screening Center    Assay Background and Significance: A small family of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) negatively regulates heterotrimeric G protein signaling by phosphorylating multiple sites in the cytoplasmic loops and tails of activated GPCRs [Krupnick, et al. 1998]. Through this process, cells adapt to persistent stimuli that act at GPCRs and protect themselves from damage incurred by sustained signaling. GRKs can also play maladaptive roles in human disease. GRK2 is overexpressed during heart failure, which not only uncouples cardiac receptors from the central nervous system, but also promotes the release of excessive amounts of catecholamines from the adrenal gland [Vatner, et al 1996]. Inhibition of GRK2 by transgenic peptides prevents cardiac failure in mouse models [Rockman, et al. 1998], suggesting that GRK2 is an excellent target for the treatment of heart disease. However, selective small molecule inhibitors of GRKs have not been reported, perhaps due to high homology among the active sites of GRKs and other AGC kinases. Over the last six years, our lab has made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of GRKs, and we are currently investigating the molecular basis for the selective inhibition of GRK2 by a high affinity RNA aptamer [Tse and Boger, 2005]. Preliminary crystallographic studies of this complex demonstrate that the aptamer binds primarily to the large lobe of the kinase domain, where it blocks the entrance to the nucleotide binding site of the kinase domain. In the HTS assay reported here, an RNA aptamer is used in a displacement assay to identify small molecules that bind to regions on GRK2 outside of its active site that are also critical for activity.   This is a robust flow cytometry protein interaction assay to screen for compounds that compete with RNA binding to GRK2. Using activity-based secondary screens, we will confirm which hits derived from HTS campaigns exhibit direct binding to GRK2 and inhibit kinase activity. These compounds will be further characterized to establish membrane permeability, their mode of inhibition, and their selectivity for GRK2. Although all active molecules are of interest, small molecules that do not exhibit competitive inhibition with ATP are of particular importance because they would likely represent novel and selective therapeutic leads for the treatment of heart disease.","GRK2 protein is biotinylated using biotinamidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester(Sigma). The RNA aptamer is fluorescently labeled on the 3'end with carboxyfluorescein (synthesized and labeled byIDT). Streptavidin-coated beads (Spherotech) are incubated with biotinylated GRK2 (bGRK2) at a final concentration of 2 nM for 30 minutes.   The BioTek Microflow liquid dispenser is used to dispense 4 microL of assay buffer to all but column 1 of a 384-well assay plate. The positive (blocked) control containing 50X unlabeled RNA aptamer in assay buffer is dispensed to column 1 by a Microflow liquid dispenser (BiotTek, USA). Compounds (10 microM in-well concentration) are transferred to assay wells via 100 nanoL pintool transfer on the Biomek FX liquid dispenser (Beckman Coulter, USA.  A total of 3 microL of bead suspension is dispensed into assay wells using the Nanoquot liquid dispenser (BioTek, USA). Plates are incubated at RT for 30 min. 3 microL FAM-C13.28 aptamer (final concentration 2 nanoM, supplied by the assay provider) is added to assay wells using the Microflow liquid dispenser. The reaction is incubated for one hour at RT.  In this flow cytometry-based HTS [Kuckuck, et al. 2001] a CyAn flow cytometer (Dako / Beckman Coulter) interfaced with a HyperCyt (IntelliCyt, USA) auto-sampler is used to measure the median fluorescence intensity associated with bead-bound bGRK2.

The 40% cutoff corresponds to about three times the standard deviation of PERCENT_RESPONSE  from 'non-fluorescent' test compounds.

One possible way to mitigate the progression of prion based diseases, such as Creuzfeld-Jakob disease, is to reduce the overall levels of PrP in the nerve cells.  Here the approach is to accomplish this by inhibiting the expression of PrP at the level of message translation.  To identify compounds which may reduce translation of the PrP message, compounds were assayed against H4 neuroblastoma cells transfected with a plasmid reporter construct.  The reporter consisted of a stem-loop sequence from the human Prion protein variant 2 (PRP) 5'UTR fused to a luciferase gene as well as a viral internal ribosome entry site driving Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP, signal not used in this assay) (Provided by Jack Rogers).

Description:  KCNK9 (also termed K2p9.1 or TASK-3) is a member of the two-pore domain family (KCNK) of potassium channels that contribute to resting membrane potential and the regulation of cell excitability by generating background currents [1-2].   In addition to its role in neurons where KCNK9 is most abundantly expressed, recent studies show that KCNK9 plays critical roles in a wide variety of human pathophysiologies. For example, KCNK9 is overexpressed in various human cancers and its exogenous overexpression promotes cell proliferation in culture and tumor development in animal models [3-4]. Moreover, KCNK9 deficiency causes a primary hyperaldosteronism in mouse [5].  A more recent study reports that KCNK9 mutation causes Birk Barel mental retardation dysmorphism syndrome in humans [6]. These findings suggest that KCNK9 may be a potential new therapeutic target for treating human diseases [7].  However, there are no suitable chemical probes to investigate the physiological roles of KCNK9 channels.   The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that inhibit the flow of ions through KCNK9 using a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses this channel.  Compounds selected as KCNK9 inhibitors will later be counter-screened for specificity.  Principle of the assay  Thallium based assays exploit the inherent permeability of potassium channels for another cation[8-9]. In the current work, we have used the FluxOR (Invitrogen) dye to detect changes in intracellular thallium levels. To assess potassium channel function, cells are initially loaded with FluxOR dye and incubated with test compounds prior to fluorescence signal recording.  An extracellular solution containing both thallium and potassium is then added, which depolarizes the membrane and consequently causes activation of potassium channels.  The electrochemical gradient drives the net inflow of thallium down its concentration gradient.  The accumulation of intracellular thallium will increase the fluorescence of the FluxOR dye.  In this way, the thallium signal is used as an indicator for the function of thallium permeable proteins, a method commonly used to reflect the activity of recombinantly expressed cation channels.

Bacteria typically require total iron concentrations in the uM range to support growth. Many pathogens such as P. aeruginosa produce siderophores (e.g. pyoverdine) with molecular weights below 1500 Da that bind to iron with remarkably high affinities. The PvdQ acylase is responsible for removal of the fatty acid on pyoverdine. Interestingly, mutant strains of P. aeruginosa with a deletion in the PvdQ gene do not make pyoverdine and cannot grow on iron limiting media. This primary screen aims to selectively identify small molecules inhibitors of the PvdQ enzymatic activity. The small molecules bind to PvdQ and block the deceylation of 4-methylumbelliferone laurate. The enzymatic activity of PvdQ will be measured through fluorescence emission mediated by the dissociation of  4-methylumbellerone to the fatty acid laurate.  Expected outcome: Identification of probe(s) inhibiting PvdQ enzymatic activity. Compounds (10 uM final concentration) reducing the fluorescence mediated by PvdQ and 4-methylumbelliferone by 20% in duplicate will be considered hits.","2091 Pyoverdine Inhibitors (PvdQ Primary assay PROTOCOL)  TNT assay buffer preparation:  - Tris 50 mM (pH8.0)    - NaCl 50 mM                - Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) 0.2 mM  (Sigma, C4706)             We diluted 50 mL of Tris 1M pH8.0 (stock solution), 10 mL of NaCl 5M and 50 ml TCEP 4 mM with 890 mL water. The TNT assay buffer was filtered using a filtering unit (Nalgene/Nunc 0.9 mm filter unit, catalog number 151-4020).  4-methylumbelliferyl laurate (4-MU laurate) substrate preparation (volume of substrate required to fill up about 30 1536-well black square well assay plates): 144 mg (16 mM) of 4-MU laurate (Research Organics, 0183M, MW 358.5 g/mol) was dissolved  in 25 ml isopropanol and was mixed with 2.5 ml of Triton X-100(Sigma, T8787)(0.1 volume), vortexed for 10 sec and gently mixed  with 375 ml TNT buffer (15 volumes).  Enzyme preparation: The P. aeruginaosa PvdQ was provided by Dr. Andrew Gulick, Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute, Buffalo, NY at a concentration of 10.06 mg/ml (126.6 uM stock concentration). The PvdQ preparation came as  40 ul droplets. We added 80 ul of the PvdQ preparation in 50.2 ml TNT buffer (final concentatration of 0.2 uM).  The PvdQ (0.75 ul) and 4-MU laurate (6.75 ul) solutions were dispensed using BioRaptrTM FRD microfluid workstation (Beckman Coulter) at a final concentration 0.02 uM (PvdQ) and 0.8 mM (4-MU laurate) at room temperature in 1536-well high base black barcoded plate square well assay plate (Aurora Biotechnologies, cat number 00019180BK) where 0.75 nl (10 mM compound concentration) of the MLPCN compound library was already dispensed in the assay plate. The positive control Isopropyl Dodecylfluorophosphonate (IDFP)(Cayman chemicals, cat. number 10215) was added in 24 selective wells (1.7 mM stock solution in TNT buffer to a 200 uM final concentration).  The assay plates were read at time 0 and 60 min using the Viewlux (Perkin Elmer) with 303-367 nm excitation filter and 440-460 nm emission filter. The fluorescence mediated by the enzymatic reaction was calculated as the difference between the read at 60 minutes and 0 minute.  ","PRESENCE OF CONTROLS: Neutral control wells (NC) and positive control wells (PC) were included on every plate.  EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  decreasing readout signal.  NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3): The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0. The median raw signal of the intraplate positive control wells was set to a normalized activity value of -100. Experimental wells values were scaled to this range.  PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)' in Genedata (v7.0.3) was applied to the normalized plate data.

D., Shunyou Long M.S., and Meng Wu Ph.D.  Description: In the brain, the chemical acetylcholine (ACh) exerts powerful modulatory control over arousal, motor and cognitive circuits, and has been found to be deficient in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The current drugs available to positively impact cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias are the cholinesterase inhibitors.  These prevent the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), and thus augment Ach function. Due to the limited utility of the cholinesterase inhibitors, alternative therapies to augment ACh deficits are critical in our aging population. Another vital protein, the hemicholinium-3 sensitive choline transporter (CHT) is believed to be responsible for the efficient uptake of choline by neurons to allow for ACh synthesis.  An assay system for high throughput screening has been developed to identify compounds with high selectivity for CHT.  It is anticipated that these compounds may lead to future cholinergic therapies in AD, and multiple other CNS diseases regulated by cholinergic signaling. These compounds may be able to modulate choline uptake and the levels of ACh produced in the neuron by impacting the kinetics of neurotransmitter synthesis. Such reagents would provide useful probes for the role of this transporter in normal and diseased states.   Principle of the assay This HTS assay is a choline-induced membrane potential assay measuring choline coupled sodium flow through CHT.  The kinetic relationship between sodium and choline in the transporter is not well established, but dephosphorylation of the transporter is associated with a decrease in the sodium current and a decrease in the km of transport.  Allosteric modulation of CHT may mimic this finding and induce a higher efficiency kinetic state of CHT. Compounds that decrease the signal of the choline-induced membrane potential assay at this choline concentration will be selected to retest for choline uptake.  The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that inhibit the choline induced membrane depolarization of cells by CHT using a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses choline transporter (CHT). Compounds selected as CHT inhibitors will later be counter-screened for specificity.

Another vital protein, the hemicholinium-3 sensitive choline transporter (CHT) is believed to be responsible for the efficient uptake of choline by neurons to allow for ACh synthesis.  An assay system for high throughput screening has been developed to identify compounds with high selectivity for CHT.  It is anticipated that these compounds may lead to future cholinergic therapies in AD, and multiple other CNS diseases regulated by cholinergic signaling. These compounds may be able to modulate choline uptake and the levels of ACh produced in the neuron by impacting the kinetics of neurotransmitter synthesis. Such reagents would allow greater ACh release from viable neurons not lost in the disease process and could offer advantages over cholinesterase therapy in targeting precursors rather than ACh itself. Principle of the assay This HTS assay is a choline-induced membrane potential assay measuring choline coupled sodium flow through CHT.  The kinetic relationship between sodium and choline in the transporter is not well established, but allosteric enhancement of CHT as measured with an increase in choline-induced depolarization may be linearly correlated with choline capacity. This assay will be carried out at the EC20 for choline of this CHT cell line. Compounds that increase the signal of the choline-induced membrane potential assay at this choline concentration will be selected to retest for choline uptake.   The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that allosterically activate the choline induced membrane depolarization of cells by CHT using a HEK293 cell line which stably expresses choline transporter (CHT). Compounds selected as CHT allosteric activators will later be counter-screened for specificity.

It plays a critical role in development, immune responses and many other physiological events. In mammals, the mitochondrial cytochrome c-mediated apoptotic pathway is initiated by cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Deregulation of the cytochrome c apoptotic pathway can lead to diseases such as cancer, immune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.   The overall goal of this project is to identify Apaf-1 inhibitors by high throughput screening. Apaf-1 is the essential mediator of the mitochondrial cytochrome c-mediated caspase activation pathway. In this pathway, various apoptotic stimuli can cause cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The released cytochrome c binds to and activates Apaf-1 to trigger formation of the multiprotein complex, the apoptosome. Apoptosome complex subsequently induces activation of caspases, the executioners of apoptosis. Therefore inhibition of Apaf-1 function can block caspase activation in the upstream of the pathway.   In this biochemical fluorescent assay, the Apaf-dependent activation of caspase-9 and consequently caspase-3 is detected based on ability of the activated caspase-3 to cleave a fluorogenic rhodamine 110 -labeled DEVD tetra-peptide, generating a strongly fluorescent Rh110 that is monitored fluorimetrically.

Description:  Atherosclerosis is a process in which plaques, deposits of low density lipoproteins (LDL), lipid-laden macrophages and other inflammatory cells, calcium, and cellular debris - build up in the inner lining of an artery. These plaques interfere with blood flow, damage the arterial wall, and eventually rupture, causing debris to migrate downstream, leading to myocardial infarction or stroke (1-4). Human platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (pPAFAH) is a Ca2+ independent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) identified in human plasma as the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis/inactivation of platelet activating factor (PAF) (5, 6), a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid signaling molecule (7). PAFAH catalyses the hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone of PAF converting it to lyso-PAF (8-9). PAFAH has a catalytic cysteine residue and is consequently sensitive to broadly reactive thiol alkylating agents, including N-ethylmaleimide (10); however, selective inhibitors for PAFAH have not yet been identified. Inhibiting PAFAH may thus offer a new therapeutic strategy for cancer. Development of a selective inhibitor would also aid in the investigation into PAFAH involvement in the dysregulated biochemical pathways that support tumorigenesis. As a result, the identification of inhibitors of PAFAH would help to elucidate the physiological role of this enzyme and its contribution to atherosclerosis, cancer, and other inflammatory pathologies (11).

In this assay, recombinant PAFAH1B2 protein is incubated with test compounds and a Rh-conjugated activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. The assay is performed by incubating test compounds with PAFAH1B2 for a defined period, followed by addition of the FP-rhodamine probe and measurement of fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as PAFAH1B2 inhibitors will prevent PAFAH1B2-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.39 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4.0 uL of Assay Buffer (0.01% Pluronic acid, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 1.25 uM of PAFAH1B2 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 17 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.34% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 120 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 375 nM FP-Rh probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 25 C. Fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525 nm, emission = 598 nm) for 15 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  % Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing no PAFAH1B2 protein. Low_Control is defined as wells containing PAFAH1B2 and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing PAFAH1B2 in the presence of test compounds.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-13, and for inactive compounds 13-0.

Description:  Atherosclerosis is a process in which plaques, deposits of low density lipoproteins (LDL), lipid-laden macrophages and other inflammatory cells, calcium, and cellular debris build up in the inner lining of an artery. These plaques interfere with blood flow, damage the arterial wall, and eventually rupture, causing debris to migrate downstream, leading to myocardial infarction or stroke (1-4). Human platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (pPAFAH) is a Ca2+ independent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) identified in human plasma as the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis/inactivation of platelet activating factor (PAF) (5, 6), a potent pro-inflammatory phospholipid signaling molecule (7). PAFAH catalyses the hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone of PAF converting it to lyso-PAF (8-9). PAFAH has a catalytic cysteine residue and is consequently sensitive to broadly reactive thiol alkylating agents, including N-ethylmaleimide (10); however, selective inhibitors for PAFAH have not yet been identified. Inhibiting PAFAH may thus offer a new therapeutic strategy for cancer. Development of a selective inhibitor would also aid in the investigation into PAFAH involvement in the dysregulated biochemical pathways that support tumorigenesis. As a result, the identification of inhibitors of PAFAH would help to elucidate the physiological role of this enzyme and its contribution to atherosclerosis, cancer, and other inflammatory pathologies (11).

Description:  Cardiomyopathies are myocardial diseases that often lead to cardiac remodeling to compensate for deficiencies in cardiac output (1). Cardiomyopathies are characterized as having systolic dysfunctions (i.e. reduced ejection fraction) in dilated cardiomyopathy or diastolic dysfunctions (i.e. impaired relaxation) in hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies (2). The regulated thin filament (RTF) is a multi-protein complex responsible for switching cardiac muscle contraction on and off in a calcium dependent manner. Mutations in the genes encoding RTF subunits are often the etiological agents for dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies. The RTF is comprised of troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT), tropomyosin (Tm) and F-actin. Notably, a hallmark of RTF subunit gene mutations in cardiomyopathies is their ability to alter the calcium sensitivity of cardiac muscle contraction and the morphology of the heart (3). Since multiple forms of cardiomyopathies exist, the identification of new drugs that sensitize (+) or desensitize (-) the calcium sensitivity could potentially reverse these aberrant changes. Moreover, there are no calcium desensitizers in clinical use today. As a result of this HTS campaign, the identification of RTF calcium sensitivity modulators may serve as useful tools for elucidating the roles of these proteins in cardiac muscle contraction and disease (4).

This biochemical assay employs the visible fluorophore, IANBD (4-(N-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) (Ex ~ 485 nm; Em ~ 535 nm) attached to troponin C (TnC, the Ca2+ binding subunit of the RTF) to monitor the Ca2+ dependent changes in fluorescence arising from IANBD-labeled RTF. As designed, an increase in the RTF fluorescence intensity at a fixed calcium concentration and wavelength in response to a test compound will indicate that a change in the RTF calcium sensitivity has occurred. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.2 uM at a calcium concentration corresponding to the EC20 (0.472 mM).  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of RTF Assay Buffer (3 mM EGTA, 4 mM NTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 190 mM MOPS, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% IGEPAL CA630, pH 7.20) containing 1.25X (0.0313 g/L) of RTF protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 1 ul of the 5X EC20 activation mix (2.36 mM Ca2+) in Assay Buffer was added to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and 36 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.7% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 15 minutes at 25 C.  Fluorescence was read using the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using an excitation filter of 480/20 nm and emission filter of 540/25 nm and a dichoic mirror.  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 0.472 mM Ca2+ (EC20). High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 2.9 mM Ca2+ (EC100).  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.

Although HIV encodes a natural inhibitor of A3G called Vif, it was hypothesized that the virus still benefits from the mutagenic activity of A3G (immune escape and drug resistance).    The purpose of the screening is to identify A3G inhibitor by using a fluorescence-based single-strand DNA deaminase assay.  In this assay, an A3G protein, a single-strand DNA oligonucleotide with  a 5'-CCC target site, and Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UDG) are all mixed.  After incubation at room temperature, A3G deaminates C-to-U and UDG removes the U.  1N sodium hydroxide is added to break the oligonucleotide at the abasic site.  Cleavage releases the 3' TAMRA quenching molecule from the 5' 6-FAM fluorophore, which results in fluorescence.  To select A3G-specific inhibitors, we also screen A3A since A3G and A3A have different dinucleotide deamination preferences.  REFERENCES 1- Harris, R. S., S. K. Petersen-Mahrt, and M. S.

Currently, small molecule drug-like compounds are not available for treating METH abuse. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) peptide agonists produce behaviors that are exactly opposite to the psychostimulant effects observed with methamphetamine abuse, such as hyperactivity, neurotoxicity, psychotic episodes, and cognitive deficits, and repeated administrations of NTR1 agonists do not lead to the development of tolerance [2]. These data form the basis of the idea that neurotensin receptors are valid targets for antagonizing drug seeking behaviors and preventing relapses. We propose to identify novel small molecule neurotensin receptor agonists by screening libraries of compounds using a primary assay based upon the ability of a b-arrestin fluorescent reporter to directly recognize the activated state of the NTR1. The specific aim of this primary assay is to identify small molecule agonists of the Neurotensin 1 Receptor (NTR1) using a b-arrestin high throughput, high content primary assay  References: Biology of neurotensin: revisited study.

TRHR, a drug-accessible cell surface receptor expressed in specific brain regions, and its ligand TRH have been implicated in several central nervous system disorders, including depression and anxiety. Small molecule TRHR agonists or allosteric enhancers that are metabolically stable and able to cross the blood-brain barrier might serve as probes to elucidate the roles of brain TRH receptors in animal models, and might be valuable as lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat patients with central nervous system disorders.

Description:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (A-beta; AB) in brain regions involved in memory and cognition (1). The steady-state levels of AB reflect a balance between its production via beta- and gamma-secretases and its catabolism by proteolytic degradation (2-4). Because AB cleavage products are less neurotoxic than intact AB, enzymes that cleave AB are of therapeutic interest for AD. In fact, upregulation of AB-degrading proteases can prevent AD-like pathology in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (5), suggesting that enhancing AB degradation may be therapeutic in human AD. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is an AB-degrading zinc metalloprotease that requires a free thiol and bivalent cations to degrade extracellular AB in neurons and other cell types (6-8). The deduced sequence of IDE shares little homology to other proteinases, including cysteine, metallo-, serine, or aspartic proteases (9). Most IDE is localized inside the cell (10), where it can degrade internalized insulin (11), insulin-like growth factors I and II (12), and amylin (13), which make IDE an attractive target for type-2 diabetes. However, since IDE has also been found in the extracellular space and at the plasma membrane (6), it can function as a principal protease in AB catabolism (5, 14, 15). IDE secretion is not dependent upon the classical secretion pathway (16). Studies showing reduced IDE levels in human AD patients (17, 18), combined with increased brain AB levels in IDE-deficient mice (14, 15), and association studies suggesting that IDE variants may be associated with AD severity (19-23), suggest that the identification of compounds that selectively modulate IDE activity will present as important tools for the study of IDE function, AD, and diabetes (24).

This fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay (24) employs a derivatized Abeta- peptide [Fluorescein-Abeta-(1-40)-Lys-Biotin (FAbeta-B)]. Cleavage of FAbeta-B by IDE (provided by live HEK cells in the reaction) removes the N-terminal fluorescein moiety from the Abeta-molecule. Subsequent addition of avidin to the reaction increases the effective molecular weight of intact (biotinylated) Abeta- molecules, slowing their rotation rate and reducing the degree of depolarization of plane polarized light. In contrast, cleaved AB species are unaffected by avidin and rotate rapidly, causing strong depolarization. Thus, the relative amounts of cleaved and intact forms of the Abeta- substrate can be measured. As designed, compounds that act as IDE activators will increase FAbeta-B cleavage, resulting in a greater population of cleaved, rapidly rotating FAbeta-B molecules. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 5.96 uM.  Protocol Summary:  HEK cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). Prior to the start of the assay, cells were resuspended at a concentration of 100,000 cells/ml in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Four uL of HEK cell suspension were then dispensed into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates (400 cells per well) but the high control column that received 4 uL of purified IDE enzyme at a final concentration of 2 nM (high control). Next, 45 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone (low control, 0.56% final DMSO concentration) were added to the appropriate wells.  The assay was started by dispensing 4 uL of 2X FAbetaB substrate solution (100 nM final) in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Plates were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 C, 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2. Next, 1 uL of 9X avidin solution (500 nM final) was added to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and fluorescence polarization was measured on a EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC dichroic mirror and a FITC FP filter set (excitation = 480 nm, emission = 540 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read using 30 flashes/ well for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  Percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO only. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing excess purified IDE enzyme.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-22, and for inactive compounds 22-0.

In this case the results of each separate campaign were assigned ""Active/Inactive"" status based upon that campaign's specific compound activity cutoff value. All data reported were normalized on a per-plate basis. Possible artifacts of this assay can include, but are not limited to: dust or lint located in or on wells of the microtiter plate, and compounds that quench or emit fluorescence within the well.

This family of phosphatases exhibits specificity for phosphoryl-Ser5 in the heptad repeats of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and thus inhibit initiation of transcription [1, 2]. Scps strongly associate with the REST/NRSF neuronal silencing complex that functions to inhibit transcription of neuronal genes in neuronal stem cells and in nonneuronal tissues [1]. Inhibition of Scps by dominant negative forms of the enzyme or by premature expression of the nervous system-specific microRNA miR-124, results in differentiation of neuronal stem cells into mature neurons [1, 3]. Thus small molecule inhibitors of Scps will be valuable reagents to facilitate study and understanding of nervous system development.   This biochemical assay employs a colorimetric readout based on the ability of the SCP-1 phosphatase to release an ortho phosphate from the phosphorylated 17-mer peptide substrate.  References: 1.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase 1 isoform 1,,,,uHTS Colorimetric assay for identification of inhibitors of Scp-1,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A551-SCP1-Inhibitor-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-01-26,,340929,2991,337938,340696,2986,337716,1.1,Live,biochemical format,coupled enzyme activity assay,absorbance,,,

CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) is the endogenous peptide ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR6. The receptor ligand pair is responsible for the chemoattraction of immature dendritic cells, effector/memory T cells, B cells, and also plays a role at skin and mucosal surfaces. The CCR6 receptor is expressed by B cells, subsets of T cells, and dendritic cells (DC). The link between the CCR6lCCL20 axis and cancer cell metastasis is a recent finding. There are two key studies that describe a relation between CCR6 and colorectal liver metastasis. The association between CCR6 expression levels in 64 primary tumor specimens in primary CRC and synchronous liver metastases suggests that CCR6 and CCL20 are involved in the metastatic spread to the liver.  A small molecule tool would address a key hypothesis: Modulation of the CCR6/CCL20 axis will regulate pathogenic activities of B cells in a variety of diseases including hematopoietic malignancy and cancer metastasis.  The project goal is to identify a chemical probe of CCR6 receptor that can specifically act as 'chemical modulator' of CCR6 through inhibition (antagonism) of functional response. An important objective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer metastasis modulated by the CCR6/CCL20 (MIP-3 alpha) axis.   In this assay we utilize enzyme-fragment complementation to directly measure GPCR activation. Unlike imaging or other second messenger assays, the DiscoveRx b-Arrestin assay allows for a direct measure of GPCR activation by detection of b-Arrestin binding to the CCR6 receptor. In this system, b-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of b-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) and the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids), weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of b-Arrestin and the Prolink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two b-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. Antagonists would be expected to inhibit agonist activation of the receptor resulting in the inhibition of signal formation in this assay.  References: Schutyser, E.; Struyf, S.; Van Oamme, J.

The assay relies on the tumbling of the fluorescence labeled Cdk5 oligo in solution that slows down when the much larger delta FosB protein binds to it, which causes an increase in the fluorescence polarization signal. Any compound that increases fluorescence polarization signal of a solution with low concentration of delta FosB and TAMRA-CDK5 is considered as active compound. These compounds can work directly by increasing the affinity of delta FosB for AP-1 DNA, or indirectly by increasing the affinity of delta FosB for itself thereby stabilizing dimers which in turn increases the affinity of delta FosB for AP-1 DNA.","Protocol: Mouse delta FosB is cloned into expression vector pET28a(+) and transformed into E.coli Rosetta2(DE3) strain Delta FosB is extracted from inclusion body and purified through Ni-NTA affinity purification.

The gene HKDC1 (HexoKinase Domain Containing I) was found to encode a fifth mammalian hexokinase. Since hexokinases are the first step in glucose metabolism, they play a major role in regulating the metabolic fate of glucose in the tissues they are expressed. Understanding both the proper and pathological metabolism of glucose is obviously of critical importance to deciphering the dysregulation of glucose metabolism that leads to Type 2 diabetes, a disorder of glucose metabolism that morbidly afflicts 35 million Americans and perhaps close to 200 million worldwide. It is our expectation that HTS to find small molecule inhibitors for HKDC1 will begin the process of identification of probes that can serve to help define the physiological function of this newly described enzyme and also to initiate determination of whether HKDC1 could be a target for diabetes therapeutics. The expression pattern of HKDC1 is unique among hexokinases, and this may provide some initial clues to its function in biology. Unlike hexokinase I (HK I) which is broadly expressed, HKDC1 has been found selectively in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, retina, kidney, and the jejunum segment of small intestine. Strikingly, we have found that HKDC1 mRNA and protein are greatly increased in pancreatic islets from diabetic animal models (unpublished data). Increased hexokinase activity in the insulin producing islet cells may participate in the hyperglycemia-induced decline in insulin secretion capacity in Type 2 diabetes, a phenomenon described as glucotoxicity. The retina and kidney also suffer from hyperglycemia-induced complications of diabetes that may be facilitated by the presence of HKDC1 in these tissues. Finally, the jejunum is the major site of glucose absorption from meals, and it is likely that HKDC1 plays a role in this process as well. A small molecule inhibitor of HKDC1 would be a key component of the effort to define the function of HKDC1 in mammals and could help us begin to understand whether inhibition of HKDC1 activity could be an avenue toward a novel approach to treating Type 2 diabetes and its complications.","Protocol:    A.

First, most HKs have known allosteric regulatory sites that bind substrates or substrate like molecules and regulate enzyme activity. Allosteric activation of HKDC1 has not yet been demonstrated, but HTS is probably the best approach to obtain such activators. Secondly, the example of glucokinase suggests that there may be additional, as yet undescribed, sites for allosteric activation in the HK family.

Description:  Cardiomyopathies are myocardial diseases that often lead to cardiac remodeling to compensate for deficiencies in cardiac output (1). Cardiomyopathies are characterized as having systolic dysfunctions (i.e. reduced ejection fraction) in dilated cardiomyopathy or diastolic dysfunctions (i.e. impaired relaxation) in hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies (2). The regulated thin filament (RTF) is a multi-protein complex responsible for switching cardiac muscle contraction on and off in a calcium dependent manner. Mutations in the genes encoding RTF subunits are often the etiological agents for dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies. The RTF is comprised of troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT), tropomyosin (Tm) and F-actin. Notably, a hallmark of RTF subunit gene mutations in cardiomyopathies is their ability to alter the calcium sensitivity of cardiac muscle contraction and the morphology of the heart (3). Since multiple forms of cardiomyopathies exist, the identification of new drugs that sensitize (+) or desensitize (-) the calcium sensitivity could potentially reverse these aberrant changes. Moreover, there are no calcium desensitizers in clinical use today. As a result of this HTS campaign, the identification of RTF calcium sensitivity modulators may serve as useful tools for elucidating the roles of these proteins in cardiac muscle contraction and disease (4).

This biochemical assay employs the visible fluorophore, IANBD (Ex ~ 485 nm; Em ~ 535 nm) attached to troponin C (TnC, the Ca2+ binding subunit of the RTF) to monitor the Ca2+ dependent changes in fluorescence arising from IANBD-labeled RTF. As designed, a decrease in the RTF fluorescence intensity at a fixed calcium concentration and wavelength in response to a test compound will indicate that a change in the RTF calcium sensitivity has occurred. This assay employs an EC70 calcium concentration (1.6 mM).  Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.2 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of RTF Assay Buffer (3 mM EGTA, 4 mM NTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 190 mM MOPS, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% IGEPAL CA630, pH 7.20) containing 1.25X (0.0313 g/L) of RTF protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 1 ul of the 5X EC20 activation mix (2.36 mM Ca2+) in Assay Buffer was added to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and 36 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.7% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 15 minutes at 25 C.  Fluorescence was read using the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using an excitation filter of 480/20 nm and emission filter of 540/25 nm and a dichoic mirror.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  % Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 14.3 uM Ca2+ (EC0). Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and 1.6 mM Ca2+ (EC70).  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-8, and for inactive compounds 8-0.

In order to retain possible partial inhibitors and avoid the influence of highly fluorescent artifacts, the hit cutoff for this assay was determined as Avg(Median_Low_Control) +/- 3SD(Median_Low_Control). SIDs that were found to be highly fluorescent were omitted from hit cutoff calculations.  This assay monitors the activity of recombinant RTF, which is a complex of 5 proteins.

Description:  Opiates such as morphine are the choice analgesic in the treatment of chronic pain due to their potent and rapid action. However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use.

The assay monitors GPCR-beta-arrestin proximity using low affinity fragment complementation of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). This assay employs U2OS cells which express OPRD1, OPRM1 fused to a beta-gal peptide fragment (enzyme donor), and beta-arrestin fused to the complementary beta-gal fragment (enzyme acceptor). Cells are incubated with test compound, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that induce formation of OPRD1 homodimers or OPRM1-OPRD1 (Mu-Delta) heterodimers will cause beta-arrestin recruitment, resulting in reconstitution of the beta-gal holoenzyme. The reconstituted holoenzyme can then catalyze the hydrolysis of a substrate which yields a chemiluminescent signal, resulting in increased well luminescence. Deltorphin B will be used as the high (100% RLU) control for agonists, and wells containing cells treated with DMSO will be used as the low (0% RLU) control. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The U2OS-OPRM1-OPRD1 (Mu-Delta) cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH).

The day before the assay 1000 cells in 3 uL of cell plating media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, Deltorphin B (0.9 uM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH. The assay was started by adding 2 uL of PathHuntertrade mark reagent (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol); followed by 1 hour incubation at room temperature. Then, Well Luminescence was read on the ViewLux plate reader  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  % Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing cells, Deltorphin B and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells, test compounds and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing cells and DMSO.

For consistency with the primary assay in which these compounds were identified, after 30min exposure to small molecules, proteasome inhibitor MG132 is added to elicit a stress response*. After an additional 8hr incubation, the amount of HSF-1 mediated luciferase expression is measured using a luminescence detection reagent.  *Note: This assay was originally performed with the intent to identify inhibitors of HSF-1 activity  Expected Outcome: Identification of HSF-1 inducers in those instances where there is an increase of luminescence signal due to the enhancement of HSF-1 being able to drive the expression of the luciferase reporter. Potential false positives in this assay included those compounds which act not by specifically inducing HSF-1, but by stabilizing luciferase or are broad spectrum inducers of transcription/translation, or act solely through interaction with MG132 to potentiate stress response.","Protocol: HGL HSF-1 luciferase assay:  The NIH3T3-HGL cell line is modified version of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with an integrated eGFP-Firefly luciferase fusion construct under the control of a heat shock response element.

Description:  Endocannabinoids (ECs) represent a unique group of lipids that function as chemical messengers in the nervous system. To date, the two principle ECs identified in mammals are N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). They have been implicated in various physiological and pathological functions including appetite, pain, sensation, memory, and addiction (1). Unlike traditional neurotransmitters, which are stored in vesicles, ECs are synthesized and released on demand, and then rapidly degraded to terminate signaling. Thus, the metabolic pathways that govern EC turnover are critical in determining the magnitude and duration of neuronal signaling events (2). Endocannabinoid biosynthesis, in contrast to degradation, is poorly understood. Recently, two serine hydrolases, DAGL-a and -B, were cloned and found to selectively cleave sn-1 acyl chains from diacylglycerols (DAG) to generate 2-AG in vitro (3). Their function in the nervous system was validated in vivo by the generation of DAGL-a and -B knock-out mice (4, 5). However, it is still unclear to what extent DAGL-a/B catalytic activity contributes to 2-AG-mediated signaling. The development of potent and selective inhibitors would offer a means to perturb DAGL-a/B activity in a selective, reversible, and temporally-controlled manner. Given the non-selective nature of current DAGL-a/B inhibitors (6), specific chemical probes would serve as invaluable tools to delineate DAGL-a/B function in 2-AG signaling networks of the brain.

In this assay, compounds are preincubated with membranes derived from DAGL-beta-transfected HEK293T cells, followed by incubation with the fluorogenic lipase substrate EnzChek. Fluorescence is determined at a specific time point. As designed, compounds that act as DAGLB inhibitors will slow the rate of substrate hydrolysis, resulting in a decrease in well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.17 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, DAGL-beta lysate was sonicated three times for 5 seconds, 1 minute between each pulse using a microtip. Then, 4.0 uL of Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO and 0.5 mM DTT) containing 0.375 mg/mL of DAGL-beta membrane lysate were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 26 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.52% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 60 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 5 uM EnzChek lipase substrate in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 60 minutes at 25 C. Fluorescence was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC filter set (excitation = 480 nm, emission = 540 nm) and a FITC dichroic mirror for 1 second.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing no DAGLB protein. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DAGLB and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing DAGLB in the presence of test compounds.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-42, and for inactive compounds 42-0.

LANA binding is essential for episome persistence since it tethers the KSHV DNA episome to host chromosomes and is essential for LANA to mediate replication of TR DNA. We developed a primary assay to detect the binding of LANA binding sequence (LBS) (a labeled DNA duplex containing the sequence specific binding site) to MBP- fused C-terminal LANA (C-LANA, residues 932-1162) and assess the specificity of the inhibition. The primary assay uses fluorescence polarization to determine if LBS binds to its C- LANA binding partner after addition of compound. Using our primary assay, acridine orange has an IC50 less than 10 uM, showing that intercalation into DNA is sufficient to abrogate LANA binding to LBS. Although acridine orange inhibits C-LANA binding, and will be useful as a control, it is not an ideal probe since it non-specifically intercalates into DNA.  Expected Outcome:  Polarization of emitted light is low for unbound oligonucleotide LBS tracer, but upon C-LANA binding, polarization increases.

Because of their central involvement in almost every aspect of human physiology, they also represent the largest target for medical intervention [Lin and Civelli, Annu Med 36 (2004), 204-14].  Today, GPCRs represent the target of approximately 30-40% of all drugs on the market. Indeed, of the 50 top-selling drugs in the United States in 2007, 18 target GPCRs, with combined sales of approximately 25 billion dollars.     Of about 800 GPCRs, 500 are chemosensory, representing the chemokine/chemoattractant GPCRs, and the olfactory and gustatory GPCRs.  Although the former have been thoroughly characterized for the most part, members of the latter, particularly the olfactory receptors which may include the important category of pheromones, have had only a small number of ligands identified.  The remaining GPCRs, approximately 360, constitute the transmitter GPCRs.  Of these, approximately 100 receptors still have no known ligand.  Such receptors with no known physiological ligand are referred to as orphan receptors and arose from cloning strategies based on limited homology within almost all GPCRs (predominantly during the 1990's) as well as the sequencing of the human genome (in 2000) [Chung et al, Br J Pharmacol 153 Suppl 1 (2008), S339-46].    The search for endogenous ligands for orphan GPCRs has been challenging.  This process has given rise to the field of reverse pharmacology, which uses orphan GPCRs to identify novel ligands, which together often lead to the characterization of new physiological paradigms.  Over the last 20 years, this approach has led to the deorphanization of about 300 GPCRs.  Many of the ligands were already known and their biology characterized, but their receptor was unknown.  But in some of these instances, this process also led to the identification of novel transmitters [Civelli et al., Pharmacol Ther 110 (2006), 525-32].  During the 1990's, approximately 10 GPCRs were deorphanized per year.  However, very few have been deorphanized since 2004.  In addition, no novel transmitters have been identified since that time [Chung et al, Br J Pharmacol 153 Suppl 1 (2008), S339-46].  Given these facts, the question arises as to whether the remaining orphan GPCRs will be readily deorphanized.  One major issue is that the pool of known transmitters for which no receptor is known has been essentially depleted.  Since all the possible transmitters have now been matched to GPCRs, the current orphan GPCRs can only bind unknown ligands, for which the identification is also slow and resource intense.  This is particularly true given that the concentrations of many transmitters in vivo is exceedingly low, making their identification difficult.  It is also possible that the expression of some ligands may be developmentally or environmentally regulated.  Almost all current reverse pharmacological/screening approaches rely on monitoring second messenger levels such as calcium mobilization, cAMP production and transcriptional activation.  Thus, successful screening requires knowledge of the pathway for a given receptor, in particular the G protein to which the receptor couples.  As the number of heterotrimeric G protein combinations is large, this is not a trivial task.   An alternate approach to measuring signal transduction is the monitoring receptor internalization.  Virtually all known GPCRs undergo activation-dependent internalization as a mechanism to reduce cell surface receptor numbers.  Internalization does not require G protein coupling.  Instead, the activity of one of four G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) is required.  In most instances, the binding of an accessory protein, arrestin, is also required.  One screening approach that has been developed is the recruitment of GFP-tagged arrestin to either the plasma membrane or intracellular endosomes.  The beta-Arrestin clustering assay, developed by Norak Technologies, requires high resolution imaging, well spread, adherent cells, and extensive image analysis to determine the response to a treatment. Other methods, such a receptor desensitization measurements on non-permeabilized cells rely on measurement of subtle changes in intensity. As described below, the CMU TCNP is developing sensors for GPCR responses that are readily compatible with HTS flow cytometry and multiplexing when the GPCRs are expressed in suspension cell lines.","1.

Reed, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, San Diego CA  Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process whereby cells catabolize damaged proteins and organelles for purposes of generating substrates for sustaining ATP production during times of nutrient deprivation.  The autophagic process involves membrane vesicles engulfing cytosol and organelles, delivering their contents to lysosomes for digestion.  The genes responsible for autophagy have been identified, largely through genetic analysis of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and are conserved in mammals, plants, and essentially all eukaryotes. While autophagy is critical for cell survival in the context of nutrient deprivation, circumstances where autophagy and cell death occur in tandem have been identified, especially in tumor biology.  For example, apoptosis-defective tumors are reliant on autophagy to survive metabolic stress. Also, autophagy inhibitors can be used to induce acute necrotic cell death, which may be facilitated by concurrent proteasome inhibition, enabling tumor eradication. In the adjuvant setting, and after elimination of a large proportion of the tumor by radiation and chemotherapy, the remaining cells can reside in a disrupted and stressed environment, susceptible to inhibition of the autophagy survival mechanism. Tumor cells in the process of metastasis can be similarly vulnerable.  Chemical modulators of autophagy are essentially non-existent, with the only available agent, 3-methyladenine, requiring millimolar concentrations to inhibit class III phosphatidyl inositol kinases (PI3Ks) involved in autophagy. A need exists for chemicals that target specific components of the autophagy machinery -- both for use as research tools for addressing questions about the role of autophagy in diseases such as cancer.  Autophagins are a class of cytosolic cysteine proteases required for autophagy.  The human genome contains four independent genes encoding the Autophagins, including ATG4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D. These proteases cleave Gly120 site of LC3 (ATG8) to promote its conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by a ubiquitin-like system, which is required for autophagosome formation and that participate in targeting these vesicles to lysosomes for fusion and degradation of their contents.  Autophagins also promote deconjugation of LC3-PE to liberate LC3 from membrane at or before the final stage of fusion between autophagosome and lysosomes, suggesting that deconjugation of LC3-PE is required for the fusion.   In this assay, a High Throughput Screening (HTS) assay based on fluorescence intensity is utilized to screen for compounds that inhibit Autophagin 1 (ATG4B).  The HTS assay utilizes a cleavable form of Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which is expressed as a fusion protein with the Autophagin substrate LC3/ATG8 appended to its N-terminus.  The addition of sequences to the N-terminus of PLA2 inhibits the activity of this enzyme.  Cleavage by proteases removing the N-terminal extension then restores enzyme activity, constituting the basis for a protease assay.  Together, these efforts will result in validated chemical probes for studying the autophagy in a variety of biological settings.","A.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",cysteine protease ATG4B isoform a,,,,uHTS fluorescent assay for identification of inhibitors of ATG4B,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A593-ATG4B-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-03-16,,340351,1735,338616,340119,1734,338385,1.1,Live,single protein format,coupled enzyme activity assay,fluorescence intensity,,,

Lindsley Specialized Chemistry Center: Vanderbilt Specialized Chemistry Center For Accelerated Probe Development Assay Implementation: Keon Ahghar, Stephanie Chavez, Terry Foutz, Matthew Garcia, Travis Houston, Dominique Perez  Assay Background and Significance:  G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of proteins in the human genome with over 600 members. As such they are involved in almost every aspect of normal human physiology, in addition to a multitude of pathophysiological processes, including cancer. The protein arrestin, which binds to phosphorylated  GPCRs, is now known to play critical roles not only in receptor desensitization, but also in receptor trafficking and G protein-independent signaling. We have identified a unique feature of G protein-coupled receptors whereby activation of GPCRs in the absence of normal arrestin-dependent signaling results in the rapid initiation of apoptosis, a feature that can be employed as a novel therapeutic target in cancer drug development. As a model system for our studies, we have employed the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), a member of the chemoattractant/chemokine subfamily of GPCRs, important in numerous aspects of immune function. The FPR is also expressed in high-grade gliomas, where it contributes to the aggressiveness of this deadly disease that even with state of the art treatment shows only approximately 50% survival at one year after diagnosis. Our hypothesis is that the development of small molecule inhibitors of arrestin-mediated GPCR trafficking/signaling will specifically induce apoptosis in FPR/GPCR-activated tumor cells potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.    Because this protein-protein binding interaction is solely based on a helix-groove interface with a small area of contact, we hypothesize that it is ideally suited for inhibition by small molecules that bind specifically to residues in the AP-2 groove, precluding binding of the arrestin helix into the groove.  Based on our results and those described by McMahon and colleagues [Wagener et. al., 2009], we developed a flow cytometric assay to monitor the arrestin-AP-2 interaction. For the reporter arrestin peptide, we utilized the peptide sequence of McMahon, but to the amino terminus that clearly extrudes from the binding pocket, we added two amino-hexanoic acid spacers and a terminal FITC group via a beta-Ala residue (FITC-beta-Ala-Ahx-Ahx-DIVFEDFARQRLKGMKDD, where the bold ""F"" represents F391). For the binding target we utilized a beta2 adaptin appendage construct (residues 700-937, R879A) fused to GST as described [Schmid et. al., 2006] and expressed in the BL21 strain of E. coli. As a positive control to inhibit binding of the fluorescent arrestin peptide, we synthesized the peptide, DDDIVFEDFARQRLKGMKDD.","GST-AP2 R879A is expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) plysS and the overnight cultures are spun down and resuspended in 1/10 of the original volume in PBS.  Concentrated cultures are stored at -80 degrees C until use. An aliquot of the frozen E. coli concentrate is lysed by the following method:  DNase I, Lysozyme and protease inhibitor cocktail are added to a 3milliL aliquot of E. coli and shaken gently for 30min at RT followed by sonication until the lysate appears clear and is not viscous.  The lysate is pelleted at 10k rpm for 5 min at 4 degrees C and the supernatant stored at -20 degrees C until further use.  4micron GSH Beads are resuspended by briefly vortexing at 2200 rpm repeatedly. Cleared cell lysate (50microL) is added to 3microL of the GSH beads and gently mixed in the cold room overnight.  The beads are pelleted at 8000 rpm at 4 degrees C for 5 min and the protein lysate removed.  The beads are resuspended in assay buffer (PBS, 0.05 percent Tween 20, and 0.1 percent BSA) and pelleted again.  After removal of the wash supernatant, the beads are resuspended in 2.5milliL assay buffer.  An assay plate is prepared by adding 5microL assay buffer to each well in columns 1-23 of a polystyrene 384-well plate (Greiner catalog no. 784101).  11microM Arrestin peptide (non-fluorescent) in assay buffer is added to column 24 (5microL/well) as the positive control. The final concentration of Arrestin peptide in column 24 is 5microM which is 100 fold higher than the FITC-Arrestin.  100nanoL of the library compounds in DMSO are transferred to the assay plate using the 100nanoL slot pin tool (V&P Scientific) on the Biomek FXp workstation (Beckman Coulter, USA). Compounds are only transferred in columns 3-22 of the 384 well plate. 100nanoL DMSO is transferred to columns 1, 2, 23, and 24.  Column 23 will serve as the negative control and columns 1 and 2 will be wash wells.  The beads are distributed at 3microL/well into columns 3-24 of the assay plate using the BioTek MicroFlo Select liquid dispenser and incubated at room temperature for 12 minutes.  183nanoM FITC-Arrestin is added to columns 1-24 with the BioTek nanoquot at 3microL/well and the wells mixed.

Under oxidative stress conditions, Keap1 liberates Nrf2 from its repression, resulting in an increased oxidative stress response.  This response may play a role in several diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The assay uses fluorescence polarization (FP) to measure the binding of purified recombinant Keap1 Kelch domain protein to a probe, FITC-labeled peptide from highly conserved Keap1 binding region of Nrf2 (FITC-9mer-Nrf2-NH2). When the probe binds to Kelch domain, the binding results in a high FP signal. Any compound that decreases the high FP signal may indicate the disruption of the interaction between Keap1 and Nrf2. Autofluorescent or quenching compounds will be removed by using total fluorescence filter and subsequent counterscreens.  Expected Outcome: Compounds of interest will inhibit the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, indicated by a decrease of fluorescence polarization signal generated by the binding between Keap1 protein and Nrf2 peptide.

EBV infection mimics NF-kB hyperactivation states present in many malignancies. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-kB pathways in a ligand-independent fashion.  LMP1 is expressed in most EBV-associated  lymphoproliferative and epithelial malignancies. LMP1 activates NF-kB via two cytoplasmic signaling domains. The membrane proximal ""TES1"" domain activates a non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway, while the membrane distal ""TES2"" domain activates canonical NF-kappaB. The primary screen uses a stably transfected HEK293 cell line with a doxycycline & 4-hydroxytamoxifen inducible LMP1 TES2 construct and a NF-kappaB luciferase reporter. Induction of the system will activate the NF-kappaB pathway and result in expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Inhibitors of the the pathway will block expression of the reporter construct.  Expected Outcome: Inhibitors of the LMP1 pathway will show a reduction in luminescence measured by a commercial luciferase kit (SteadyGlo, Promega.)  Later assays will determine whether this loss of signal is due to inhibition of the pathway of interest or due to off-target or general toxicity effects.","LMP-1 Screening Protocol (Luciferase reporter assay)  Day 0, cell grown in HyperFlask (Corning) to 95% confluence to yield 273 Million (TrypLE phenol free) and resuspended to dispensing at 150,000 cells / mL of phenol free DMEM  Day 1, plate cells 3000 per well in 20 uL media (phenol red free DMEM/10% Tet Free FBS/Pen/Strep/L-Glutamine); incubate in standard TC conditions (5% CO2; 95% humidity, 37C) for 24 hours.

V-ATPases maintain the low pH necessary for endocytic and exocytic vesicular transport, zymogen activation, and protein sorting and degradation. Enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus, as well as toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, enter cells via acidic endosomal compartments, in which low pH is maintained by V-ATPases. Because the pH influences most aspects of cell physiology most cells will die without functional V-ATPases. Inhibition of the V-ATPase is a quick-acting way to disrupt vital cell functions.  It is probably for this reason that some organisms evolved to produce natural products that inhibit V-ATPases. However, these inhibitors have poor selectivity and/or potency. For instance, bafilomycins and concanamycins, which are inhibitors broadly used to study V-ATPases in vitro and in vivo cannot discriminate between fungal and mammalian V-ATPases; other compounds preferentially inhibit the mammalian V-ATPase (salicylihalamides and lobatamides) but cannot discriminate between human V-ATPase tissue specific isoforms; and those compounds that preferentially inhibit fungal V-ATPases (chondropsines) have very low potency, even lower than bafilomicyns and concanamycins which require micromolar concentrations to inhibit the yeast pump in vivo. This phenotypic study is designed to identify small molecules that inhibit fungal V-ATPase pumps with high potency in vivo.","Overnight cultures of BY4741 S. cerevisiae cells expressing pHLuorin  were resuspended in 2-fold diluted fresh 50% SC media containing 1% BSA to a cell density of 0.2 -0.4 OD600/milliL (1-2 x 10e7 cells/milliL).

Drug-resistant strains of this parasite have emerged and threaten the utility of conventional anti-malarial compounds used to fight this disease. In a variety of fungal species, it has been shown that HSP90 inhibitors can reverse drug resistance, and this may be true for other eukaryotic pathogens such as P. falciparum. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibitors show potent anti-malarial activity against Plasmodium strains in culture. As global inhibition of HSP90 may be harmful in disease-compromised individuals, here we propose a strategy to discover compounds that specifically inhibit the malarial homolog of this protein.  The goal of this project is to identify inhibitors of the protein HSP90 specific to the malarial species P.falciparum. As strains of P. falciparum have developed resistance to conventional anti-malarial drugs and spread worldwide, creating drugs that operate through a novel mechanism is critically important. Previous work shows both that inhibition of HSP90 in fungi can reverse drug resistance and that inhibitors of HSP90 are very potent in killing P. falciparum in infected red blood cells, therefore new drugs that target HSP90 may provide an excellent method to combat this deadly disease.  Strains of yeast with PfHsp90 have shown some utility as a tool to understand biology of this important protein, however a strains with wild-type PfHsp90 are limited in their utility for a small molecule screen by a slow growth phenotype. Previous work demonstrated that these yeast strains did not grow well enough to evaluate the effect of a drug on survival. We have created yeast strains with a single point mutation that allows them to grow at a much increased rate, and therefore makes them much more useful in a screening context. We have engineered yeast strains that survive and grow using either the P. falciparum (Pf) or human (Hs) ortholog to replace the fungal homolog of the essential protein Hsp90. These strains respond to known Hsp90 inhibitors, and show the expected selectivity of inhibition of HsHsp90 strains over PfHsp90 yeast.  Yeast strain W303-alpha-delta-pdr1-delta-pdr3 with a Trp-2micron plasmid with PfHsp90 under the GPD promoter are inoculated from a plate culture (maintained at 4 deg C for less than 4 weeks) into 25 mL of SD-Trp synthetic yeast medium and shaken overnight at 23 deg C.Optical density is diluted down to a final OD600 of 0.00015 in assay media; radicicol is added to positive control wells.

Expected Outcome:  Inhibitors of the essential Pf Hsp90 will inhibit growth of the yeast, resulting in a loss of luminescent signal relative to the neutral controls.  Later assays will determine whether this is due to specific inhibition of Hsp90 or due to general toxicity.l","SD-Trp synthetic medium: Per 1L: 1.7 g YNB without amino acids and ammomium sulfate (Sigma part #Y1250) 0.74g CSM-Tryp (Sunrise Science part # 1007-100) 1g glutamic acid monosodium salt (Sigma part # G1626) 20g D-glucose (Sigma part# G7021)  1) Inoculate S. cerevisiae (W303-alpha-delta-pdr1-delta-pdr3 with a Trp-2micron plasmid with PfHsp90 under the GPD promoter) into 25 mL of SD-Trp synthetic yeast medium 2) Shake overnight at 23 deg C. 3) Dilute down to a final OD600 of 0.00015 in assay media (SD-Trp medium) 4) Radicicol in assay medium is added to positive control wells to 20 uM final concentration. 5) Dispense 40 uL culture in 384-well plates using a Combi multidrop dispenser (Thermo) 6) Test compounds are transferred using the 100 nL robotic pin tool (HiRes Biosolutions) 7) After 48 hour incubation @ 30 degrees C., luminescence reagent bactiterglo (Promega) is added, 30 uL per well diluted 4x from manufacturers stock with PBS.

Description:  Opiates such as morphine are the choice analgesic in the treatment of chronic pain due to their potent and rapid action. However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphines potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mudelta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether compounds are non-selective GPCR inhibitors/inverse agonists. The assay monitors GPCR-beta-arrestin proximity using low affinity fragment complementation of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). This assay employs U2OS cells which express HTR5A fused to a beta-gal peptide fragment (enzyme donor), and beta-arrestin fused to the complementary beta-gal fragment (enzyme acceptor). Cells are incubated with test compound, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit HTR5A will prevent beta-arrestin recruitment, thereby reducing the reconstitution of the beta-gal holoenzyme. The decrease in reconstituted holoenzyme will reduce the hydrolysis of a substrate which yields a chemiluminescent signal, resulting in decreased well luminescence. Wells containing Cell Plating Media (No cells) and treated with DMSO will be used as the high (100% RLU) control for inverse agonists, and wells containing cells treated with DMSO will be used as the low (0% RLU) control. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The U2OS-HTR5A cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Hams F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) and Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated certified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 250 ug/mL Hygromycin B, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day before the assay 1000 cells in 3 uL of cell plating media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH. The assay was started by adding 2 uL of PathHunter  reagent (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol); followed by 1 hour incubation at room temperature. Then, Well Luminescence was read on the ViewLux plate reader  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( ( RLU_Test_Compound - Median_RLU_Low_Control ) / ( Median_RLU_High_Control - Median_RLU_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing no cells and DMSO, Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells, test compounds and DMSO, Low_Control is defined as wells containing cells and DMSO.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Four values were calculated for each assay plate:  (1) The average percent inhibition of Low control wells; (2) Three times the standard deviation of this subset; (3) The average percent inhibition of test compound wells with percent inhibition greater than the difference of (1) and (2); (4) Three times the standard deviation of this subset.  The sum of (3) and (4) was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  In this assay not all plates were run in the same batch.  This resulted in batch-to-batch variation among the different batches of plates, thereby necessitating the use of a plate-based activity cutoff.  For this reason the inactive and active scores overlap.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-17, and for inactive compounds 58-0.

Due to increasing regional distribution and resistances against the clinically used antimalarials, novel antimalarial drugs - which have new mechanisms of action and are suitable for combination therapies - are urgently required. Plasmodium falciparum Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (PfGluPho) is a potential novel target for antimalarial drug design. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) reaction is the first and rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme Plasmodium falciparum Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-6-Phosphogluconolactonase (PfGluPho) catalyzing the first two steps of the PPP, a key metabolic pathway sustaining anabolic needs in reductive equivalents and synthetic materials in fast-growing cells. Plasmodium falciparum cells and infected host RBCs rely on accelerated glucose flux and are dependent on glucose-6-phopshate dehydrogenase activity of PfGluPho. The parasite enzyme is essential for plasmodium proliferation and it differs structurally and mechanistically from the human enzyme, thus making it an excellent target for novel antimalarial drug design. Prior to this study PfGluPho protein was unavailable and its selective and specific inhibitors are non-existent. Given this gap, our rationale in developing a HTS screen is to find chemical probes that inhibit Plasmodium G6PD activity that might lead to novel anti-malarial therapies.  Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD), an enzyme that converts Glucose-6-Phosphate to 6-Phosphoglucono-delta-lactone, is the first and rate-limiting step of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), one of the key pathways for glucose metabolism in most cells. The activity of G6PD determines whether glucose is metabolized through glycolysis or the PPP. In contrast to glycolysis, the primary role of the PPP is anabolic rather than catabolic, providing NADPH for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as Ribose-5-Phosphate as the precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids, which is especially important for rapidly growing plasmodium cells. Parasite and plasmodium-infected host cells demonstrate elevated rates of glucose consumption comparing to uninfected red blood cells.  The purpose of this assay is to identify inhibitors of human Plasmosium falciparum G6PD. This is accomplished by using a G6PD- NADPH-coupled assay. In the assay G6PD activity is detected through conversion of its product, glucose-6-phosphate, to 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone concomitant with NADP-to-NADPH. The NADPH is then detected via a resazurin-diaphorase fluorogenic reaction.","pfG6PDH Assay HTS Protocol:  A.

Its utilization for the pfG6PD assay is described below.  Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-6-phosphogluconolactonase,,,,uHTS identification of small molecule inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase via a fluorescence intensity assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A639-pfG6PDH-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-04-20,,349168,2717,346451,348923,2710,346216,1.3,Live,biochemical format,coupled enzyme activity assay,fluorescence intensity,,,

Description:  Opiates such as morphine are the choice analgesic in the treatment of chronic pain due to their potent and rapid action. However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen to determine whether compounds identified as active in a previous set of experiments entitled, ""Luminescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of heterodimerization of the mu 1 (OPRM1) and delta 1 (OPRD1) opioid receptors"" (AID 504326) are non-selective GPCR activators/agonists.  The assay monitors GPCR-beta-arrestin proximity using low affinity fragment complementation of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). This assay employs U2OS cells which express HTR5A fused to a beta-gal peptide fragment (enzyme donor), and beta-arrestin fused to the complementary beta-gal fragment (enzyme acceptor). Cells are incubated with test compound, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that activate HTR5A will cause beta-arrestin recruitment, resulting in reconstitution of the beta-gal holoenzyme. The reconstituted holoenzyme can then catalyze the hydrolysis of a substrate which yields a chemiluminescent signal, resulting in increased well luminescence. Serotonin (5HT) will be used as the high (100% RLU) control for agonists, and wells containing cells treated with DMSO will be used as the low (0% RLU) control. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The U2OS-HTR5A cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated certified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 250 ug/mL Hygromycin B, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  The day before the assay 1000 cells in 3 uL of cell plating media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 23 hours. Next, 28 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH. The assay was started by adding 2 uL of PathHunter trade mark reagent (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol); followed by 1 hour incubation at room temperature. Then, Well Luminescence was read on the ViewLux plate reader  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( RLU_Test_Compound - Median_RLU_Low_Control ) / ( Median_RLU_High_Control - Median_RLU_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing cells, 5HT and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells, test compounds and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing cells and DMSO.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  In this assay not all plates were run in the same batch.

Description:   Protein phosphorylation is one of the most important mechanisms for regulation in mammalian cells, and cAMP is an ancient second messenger signaling molecule. Protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitous cAMP-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates intracellular protein substrates in response to the secondary messenger, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). It has several functions in the cell, including regulation of immune response (1), transcription (2), cell cycle and apoptosis (3). PKA exists in its native inactive form as a 4 subunit enzyme with two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. The regulatory R-subunits are the primary receptors for cAMP, while the catalytic (C) subunit serves as the prototype for the protein kinase superfamily. In the absence of cAMP the R-subunit binds with high affinity to the catalytic (PKAC) subunit and renders it inactive. Cooperative binding of cAMP to the R-subunit induces significant conformational changes, to release the inhibitory binding and thus unleash the enzyme activity (4). Thus PKA serves to couple protein phosphorylation and cAMP second messenger signaling pathways (5-6). Crystal structures of regulatory subunits isoforms R1A, R2A and R2B and their complexes with the PKAC reveal that novel pockets are formed in the complexes that are unique from the binding sites in the cAMP bound form (7- 9). As a result the identification of novel small molecules targeting the PKA holoenzymes will provide insight into cAMP signaling (10). Abundant studies have linked deregulation of PKA to several diseases. For example, Carney complex (CNC) is an inherited tumor predisposition disease caused by mutations in R1A gene (11). R1A has also been shown to be a bone tumor suppressor; deletion of R1A gene in mouse caused osteosarcoma (12), the second highest cause of cancer-related death in the pediatric age group. Identifying compounds targeting specifically to R-subunit isoforms will hopefully open up new avenues for the cure of some of these diseases.  References:  1. 1.

This fluorescent polarization-based assay monitors activation of PKA holoenzyme (Saldanha et al, 2006). This assay employs a 20-residue peptide (IP20) ligand conjugated at the N-terminus with Cy5 (Cy5-IP20) that binds the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAc) with high affinity. The sample is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. As designed, compounds that activate the PKA-R2B holoenzyme, will induce PKAc dissociation from the R2B subunit, causing the free PKAc subunit to bind to the labeled Cy5-IP20, increasing the Cy5-IP20 effective molecular weight, slowing its rotation rate, and increasing the polarization signal of the sample. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 11 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Protein Mix containing assay buffer (40 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mM ATP, 0.02% BSA, 0.01% Triton-X100, 10 mM Magnesium sulfate, 1 mM DTT and 10 nM Cy5-IP20) with 45nM PKAc and 56 nM R2B protein was prepared. Next, 4.0 uL of Protein Mix was dispensed into 1536-well microtiter plates. The was assay started by dispensing 46 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (1% final concentration) to the appropR1Ate wells. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.  Fluorescence polarization was read on an Envision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a Cy5 FP filter set (Excitation = 620 nm, Emission = 688 nm) and a Cy5 dichroic mirror.   The well Fluorescence Polarization value (P) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) polarization values using the following formula:   P = (S * P) / (S * P)  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( Test_Compound_P - median_Low_Control_P ) / ( median_High_Control_P - median_High_Control_P ) ) *100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Protein mix in the presence of test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Protein mix. High_Control is defined as wells containing Protein mix and 113 uM cGMP.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-17, and for inactive compounds 17-0.

Resistance typically occurs as a result of chromosomal mutation or acquisition of a mobile genetic element, such as a plasmid, that harbors resistance-mediating genes.  One of the most common plasmid maintenance systems is the toxin-antitoxin (TA) postsegregational killing mechanism.  In this mechanism, if a plasmid-free daughter cell arises, the labile antitoxin is degraded and the toxin induces cell death.  TA genes are ubiquitous in clinical isolates of certain drug-resistant bacteria, and it has been postulated that compounds that disrupt the TA interaction could free the toxin to kill the bacterial cell.  The goal of this screen is to identify compounds that can disrupt the MazEF TA system and effectively activate the MazF toxin.  The discovery of such compounds would enable the validation of toxin activation as a novel antibacterial strategy, and the compounds themselves would have potential as antimicrobial agents.  The high-throughput screen described here will enable us to readily identify small molecules that activate RNase-based toxins. A fluorophore and a quencher are on the opposite ends of an oligonucleotide substrate. When the RNase (in this case the MazF toxin) cleaves the oligonucleotide, it liberates the fluorophore from the quencher, resulting in a dramatic increase in fluorescence.  REFERENCES 1.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f.

Description:  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in initiating inflammatory responses to a number of components of pathogens as well as markers of sterile injury. As such they initiate homeostatic responses but also pathologic responses. Our focus on TLR9 is based on its role in autoimmune disease. Auto-antibodies to DNA, RNA, or both are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1). Auto-antibody production depends on the endosomal TLRs such as TLR9 and TLR7 that bind DNA (TLR9) or RNA (TLR7). Identifying specific inhibitors of TLR9 is important for furthering the understanding of SLE. To date, with one exception, all the non-protein molecules that alter TLR responses are ligand analogs that react with the extra-cytoplasmic ligand binding portions of the TLRs. The sole exception, TAK-242, is a TLR4 inhibitor that was withdrawn from further development as a drug (http://www.takeda.com, Feb. 20, 2009) for unspecified reasons. The assays we are developing are designed to identify small molecules that interfere with the first interaction of the receptor with the proximal intracellular signaling adapter, which in the case of TLR9 is MyD88. Such inhibitors will not be competitive with receptor ligands. They have the potential to be highly specific in their action among members of the TLR family because the interactions of MyD88 with each TLR member are unique, despite the structural similarities in the family (2). The rationale for this approach is that it will permit the identification of a new class of inhibitors enabling a variety of innovative approaches to research and therapeutics, not only for SLE, but also for other immunological processes in which the TLRs are involved.

This assay uses a CHO cell line that was generated to stably express two beta-lactamase (BLA) fragment fusion proteins: a chimera of MyD88 fused to BLA fragment ""a"" and a chimera of TLR9 fused to BLA fragment ""b"". These cells have constitutive BLA activity due to the interaction of the TLR9 and MyD88 components of the chimeras, which brings together BLA fragments ""a"" and ""b"", to reconstitute full length BLA. As designed, test compounds from the MLSCN library which interrupt TLR9 and MyD88 interaction will disrupt reconstitution of the BLA fragments and reduce BLA activity. BLA activity is detected by measuring fluorescence of the cleavable BLA substrate CCF4-AM, which yields either blue fluorescence at 450 nm (no FRET) or green fluorescence at 535 nm (FRET). Test compounds from the MLSCN library were screened for inhibition of constitutive TLR9-MyD88 binding as measured by changes in the ratio of fluorescence emissions at 450 nm and 535 nm. Clavulanic acid, an inhibitor of BLA activity, was implemented as a non specific control. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.98 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The stably transfected TLR9 MyD88 CHO cells were cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 200 ug/mL geneticin (G418) and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of 200,000 cells/ml in DMEM (Phenol Red Free), containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 10 mM Hepes, 5mM L-Glutamine and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin. To start the assay, 5 ul of assay media was dispensed into the first two columns of a 1536 well plate and 5 ul of cell suspension to the remaining wells (1,000 cells per well). Plates were centrifuged and then incubated at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH for 19 hours. Next, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, Clavulanate (210 uM final concentration) or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  Then, 1 ul of the fluorogenic CCF4-AM substrate, prepared according to manufacturer's protocol (LiveBLAzer, Invitrogen), was added to each well. After 2 hours of incubation at 25 C, well fluorescence was measured on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 450 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting ""background"" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media only. Background corrected fluorescence emission values were then used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I450_nm / I535_nm  Where:  I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nm.  Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 0.5% DMSO (0% inhibition) High_Control is defined as wells containing 210 uM clavulanate in 0.5% DMSO (100% inhibition).  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-22, and for inactive compounds 22-0.

Description:  Nuclear receptors are a family of small molecule and hormone-regulated transcription factors that share conserved DNA-binding (DBD) and ligand-binding domains (LBD) (1-3). Of interest, DAX-1 (NR0B1; nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1; dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome gene 1) is an orphan nuclear receptor shown to act as a robust transcriptional repressor, inhibiting genes involved in steroidogenesis through interaction with corepressors and regulating the pluripotency of stem cells (4-8). The human DAX-1 gene encodes a protein whose C terminus is similar to the LBD of nuclear hormone receptors, while its N terminus is composed of three cysteine-rich 70 amino acids with little similarity to known proteins (4, 7). Mutations in DAX-1 have been shown to cause the X-linked form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC), associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG). AHC-HHG-associated mutations share an altered DAX-1 C-terminal domain (5, 9), resulting in loss of transcriptional repression activity (5, 7, 9), which suggests that impairment of the DAX-1 transcriptional activity is directly linked to AHC-HHG pathogenesis. In addition, DAX-1 is highly expressed in pediatric Ewing tumors (10). As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of DAX-1 will serve as useful tools to elucidate its roles of in steroidogenesis, tumorigenesis, and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (8).

This assay employs HEK293 cells co-transfected with a GAL4DBD-DAX1 C-terminal construct (pG4D 207-470) and a luciferase reporter under control of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter preceded by yeast Gal4 binding sites (pGAL4-tk-luc). In this assay, transfected cells are incubated with test compounds, followed by measurement of well luminescence. DAX1 activity represses expression of the luciferase reporter plasmid. As designed, a DAX1 inhibitor will prevent or reduce DAX-1-mediated transcriptional repression, leading to increased expression of the luciferase reporter gene, and increased well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.75 uM.  Protocol Summary:  HEK293 cells were routinely cultured in T-175 flasks containing 25 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic mix. Flasks were then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, the HEK293 cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE reagents and resuspended in fresh media at a density of 1 million cells per mL. Next, 115 mL of the cell suspension were dispensed into 5-layer culture flasks and allowed to attach for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. Cells were then transfected with 5 mL of serum-free OptiMEM containing 90 ug of the pGal4-tk-luc reporter plasmid, 50 ug of the Gal4 DBD-DAX1 fusion expression vector pG4D207-470, and 400 uL of transfection reagent. Four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 25 mL of preheated TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 750,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM supplemented as above. In the absence of a pharmacological positive control, DAX-1 inhibition was mimicked by transfecting cells with the empty vector pG4MpolyII instead of the pG4D207-470 vector.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, solid-bottom 1536-well plates using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora). The first three columns received control cells whereas the rest of the plate was dispensed with DAX1-transfected cells. The plates were then treated with 35 nL/well of test compounds or DMSO (final concentration 0.76%) on DAX-1 cells and Control cells using a PinTool transfer unit (GNF). Plates were incubated for eighteen hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95%RH. Plates were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by addition of 5 uL of SteadyLite reagent to each well. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent inhibition of each test compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( median_positive_control - test_compound ) / (median_positive_control - median_negative_control ) * 100  Where:  Positive control is defined as wells containing control cells treated with DMSO. Negative control is defined as wells containing DAX-1 cells treated with DMSO. Test compound is defined as wells containing DAX-1 cells containing test compound.

Zervos, University of Central Florida External Assay ID: HTRA1_INH_FP_1536_1X%INH PRUN  Name: Fluorescence polarization-based primary biochemical high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the HTRA serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1).  Description:  High temperature-responsive antigen (HTRA) proteins comprise a family of four serine proteases that play critical roles in a diversity of biological processes, including protein quality control, especially under conditions of cellular stress (1, 2). One member, HTRA1, has been shown to play a role in osteoarthritis (3-6), Alzheimer's disease (7), and age-related macular degeneration (8-9). Overexpression of the HTRA1 gene or over-activity of the enzyme is always associated with these conditions. HTRA1 has also been shown to play a role in chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian (10) and gastric cancers (11) and in mesothelioma (12). HtrA1, an extracellular secreted protein, has a highly conserved chymotrypsin-like serine protease domain and a PDZ protein-protein interaction motif at its carboxyl terminus (1). The amino terminal region contains a predicted signal peptide, an IGF binding domain, as well as protease inhibitor domains (1). The normal function of HtrA1 is unclear, but is expected to involve cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins. A number of these target substrates have been identified and include C-polypeptides of fibril-forming types I, II and III procollagen (13), fibronectin (5) and proteoclycans. HTRA1 has also been shown to regulate TGF-beta signaling (14). As a result, a specific inhibitor for this serine protease would be invaluable in basic studies to elucidate the normal function of HTRA1 and its deregulation in the development and progression of human disease, and could potentially lead to the development of new and effective clinical interventions.

In this assay, recombinant HTRA1 protein is incubated with test compounds and an Rh-conjugated activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. The assay is performed by incubating test compounds with HTRA1 for a defined period, followed by addition of the FP-rhodamine probe and measurement of fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as HTRA1 inhibitors will prevent HTRA1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 5.96 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of Assay Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% Pluronic F-127, and 1 mM DTT) containing 1.06 uM of HTRA1 protein was dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.59% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 250 nM FP-TAM probe in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 30 minutes of incubation at 25 C, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525 nm, emission = 598 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 15 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing HTRA1 and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing HTRA1 in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing no HTRA1 protein.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-10, and for inactive compounds 10-0.

Inhibitors that trap the covalent intermediate formed by bacterial type IA topoisomerases could be developed into novel therapeutics compounds for bacterial pathogens  including gram negatives. An oligo nucleotide substrate with a fluorescent reporter at the 5' end and a quencher at the 3' end is used in this assay. The fluorescence signal is normally quenched due to base pairing in the short stem of the structure. The substrate alone in solution yields very low fluorescence. Upon cleavage in the loop region  by Topoisomerase I, a small increase in signal is observed. Mg2+ under physiological conditions stabilizes the stem structure by shifting the cleavage-religation equilibrium towards religation. 0.5mM  MgCl2  is included in the assay to keep the background signal low. The addition of small molecules acting as topoisomerase poisons that shift the cleavage-religation equlibrium  towards cleavage is expected to increase the fluorescent signal.  To rule out autofluorescence artifacts, an autofluorescent assay involving hit compounds and assay buffer will be executed. Compounds exhibiting auto-fluorescence under assay conditions will be eliminated.

Although recent clinical trials with orthosteric antagonists have not produced a successful drug because of a hyperthermia side effect and their tendency to block thermal noxious pain, this ion channel is undeniably well placed in the pain pathway, and the idea of blocking pain signals before they enter the CNS is an excellent concept and of proven efficacy when TRPV1 agonists are used. We propose a new approach involving allosteric modulation to impose an activity-dependent constraint within the context of inflammation and tissue damage that would alter the responsiveness of the channel in a way that an orthosteric vanilloid antagonist cannot achieve. We believe that the allosteric modulator approach has not been explored for this target.  The main goal of this proposal is to identify additional, new, potent allosteric modulators of TRPV1 that can be used to investigate TRPV1 function. Our recent report provides evidence of proof of concept, but the compounds are just at the edge of utility in terms of potency. Thus, the goal of this high throughput screening proposal is to identify more potent compounds for use as probes in molecular-cellular and whole animal studies and as leads for further optimization.

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease-associated mutations (1-4). However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases.

This assay employs the cAMP Perkin Elmer LANCE Ultra cAMP competitive immunoassay kit and cells that stably express the Gs-coupled human receptor MC4R. This receptor signals through adenylyl cyclase to trigger the cAMP cascade. Labeled anti-cAMP antibody and Europium-labeled cAMP (Eu-cAMP) are included for TRFRET-based detection of receptor activity. In this assay, cells are incubated with test compounds, labeled cAMP antibody and Eu-cAMP. Binding of the labeled cAMP antibody to Eu-cAMP causes energy transfer from the Eu-cAMP molecule to the labeled-antibody, increasing well FRET. Ligand-mediated MC4R activation stimulates endogenous cellular cAMP production by the cells, which competes with the labeled cAMP for binding to the labeled cAMP-antibody, thereby reducing FRET. As designed, compounds that act as antagonists will prevent receptor activation, reduce cellular cAMP production, reduce levels of cAMP available to compete with labeled Eu-cAMP, leading to increased interactions between Eu-cAMP and the labeled anti-cAMP antibody, and resulting in increased well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 6.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The MC4R cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated certified fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 250 ug/mL Geneticin, 250 ug/mL Hygromycin B, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin). The day of the assay, 1500 cells in 3 uL of cell media (HBSS, 25 mM HEPES and 0.1% BSA) were seeded into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Then, 26 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone was added to the appropriate wells and plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, 1 uL of the MC4R agonist, Melanotan II (Mel II), in assay buffer (""EC Challenge"" consisting of HBSS, 25 mM HEPES, 100 uM Ro 20-1724 and 0.1% BSA), or assay buffer alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. After incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, 1 uL of Eu-cAMP (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) followed by 1 uL of labled-anti-cAMP (prepared in lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Incubation was continued at room temperature for 1 hour before measurement of well FRET. After excitation at 340 nm (with 30 nm bandwidth), well fluorescence was monitored at 671 nm (with 4 nm bandwidth), using the Envision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer). For each well, fluorescence was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Fl = I671nm  Where:  I671nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 671 nm.  Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Fl_Test_Compound - Median_Fl_High_Control ) / ( Median_Fl_Low_Control -Median_Fl_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Mel II challenge. High_Control is defined as wells containing Mel II challenge and IC100 of MC4R antagonist (MCL0020).  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-4, and for inactive compounds 4-0.

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease-associated mutations (1-4). However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases.

The assay monitors GPCR-beta-arrestin proximity using low affinity fragment complementation of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). This assay employs U2OS cells which express MC4R fused to a beta-gal peptide fragment (enzyme donor), and beta-arrestin fused to the complementary beta-gal fragment (enzyme acceptor). Cells are incubated with test compound, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that activate MC4R will cause beta-arrestin recruitment, resulting in reconstitution of the beta-gal holoenzyme. The reconstituted holoenzyme can then catalyze the hydrolysis of a substrate which yields a chemiluminescent signal, resulting in increased well luminescence. Melanotan II will be used as the high (100% RLU) control for agonists, and wells containing cells treated with DMSO will be used as the low (0% RLU) control.

It is thought that small molecule inhibition of Rtt109 activity in vivo could be a viable route to a novel antifungal which may work alone or in combination with existing anti-fungal treatments.  Rtt109 acetyl transferase specificity is dictated by the chaperones Vps75 or Asf1.  For this assay, purified Rtt109/Vps75 complex is combined with Histone H3 N-terminal Peptide 1-20, acetyl-CoA, and compound of interest.  The enzymatic reaction is allowed to proceed for 4 hrs and then a thiol detection reagent (ThioGlo-1) is added.  The reagent reacts with S-CoA generated as a product of the enzymatic reaction.  The resulting flourescence is proportional to the activity of the enzyme.  Expected Outcome:  If a compund of interest inhibits the enzyme, less S-CoA will be generated over the course of the assay leading to a smaller fluorescent intensity.","Assay ready plates are prepared with 7.5 nL DMSO compound stocks  (nominally 10 mM, final concentration 25 uM) in Aurora 1536 black wall clear bottom plates.

NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3): The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0. The median raw signal of the intraplate positive control wells was set to a normalized activity value of -100. Experimental wells values were scaled to this range. All well activities were then multiplied by -1 to create a positive activity readout value range, to match Pubchem convention.  PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Assay Pattern (additive)' in Genedata (v7.0.3) was applied to the normalized plate data.

Description:  The most frequently inherited early-onset ataxia in Caucasians is Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. FRDA is associated with progressive neurological disability, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased risk of diabetes mellitus, severe disruption of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, mitochondrial iron overload coupled to cellular iron dysregulation, and an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (1, 2). FRDA results from severely reduced levels of frataxin, a small, highly conserved mitochondrial protein of uncharacterized function (3). Transcriptional silencing of the FXN gene is induced by expansion of GAA repeats in the first FXN intron (3, 4), and inhibits FXN expression through a heterochromatin-mediated repression mechanism (5). Importantly, the FXN coding sequence is intact and capable of expressing functional frataxin. FRDA patients homozygous for the GAA expansion have very low frataxin mRNA and protein levels when compared with heterozygous carriers and healthy controls. Thus far, a limited number of compounds have been shown to alleviate GAA-induced transcriptional silencing in vitro (6-9). As there are no treatments that have been shown to stop the progression of FRDA, the objective of this project is to identify new pharmacological probes able to stimulate gene expression blocked by pathologically expanded GAA repeats. This project can lead to the discovery of new compounds with therapeutic activity in FRDA and may be applicable in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for Fragile X syndrome, other neurological diseases, as well as cancer.

In this assay HEK293 cells expressing a lucGAA850 construct used to drive expression of the firefly luciferase gene are incubated with test compounds for 24 hours, followed by cell lysis using the ONE-Glo reagent (Promega) which contains the luciferase substrate 5 -fluoroluciferin. As designed, a compound that activates the GAA850 promoter will increase expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene, leading to increased production of luciferase enzyme, and increased luciferase-mediated substrate mono-oxygenation in the presence of ATP, magnesium, and molecular oxygen. Levels of the resulting product, oxyfluoroluciferin, are monitored as an increase in well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6 uM.

Flasks were then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day of the assay, the GAA850 cells were harvested using 5 mL of 0.05% trypsin reagents and resuspended in assay media containing DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% v/v penicillin streptomycin, and 25 ng/ml tetracycline at a density of 321,000 cells/ml.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, solid-bottom 1536-well tissue culture treated plates. followed by the addition of30 nL/well of test compounds or DMSO (final concentration 0.45%). Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, removed from the incubator, and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes, Then 5 uL of ONE-Glo reagent was added to each well. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).

Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing 10 uM SAHA (a non-specific control compound).  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.

Description:  The rise in antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the lack of drugs capable of efficiently eradicating persistent bacilli responsible for life-long infections in humans emphasize the need for novel anti-TB agents with mechanisms of action different from those of existing drugs(1, 2). In fact, the latent form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects approximately a third of the global population (3). Class II fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key enzyme of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis induced in M. tuberculosis grown under oxygen-limiting conditions thought to mimic the physical microenvironment encountered by persistent bacilli in pulmonary lesions. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) catalyzes the conversion of fructose bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in a reversible fashion. As a result, this enzyme is a likely target for molecular tools to kill multi-drug-resistant as well as persistent M. tuberculosis (2).  Selective inhibition of FBA is expected to prevent M. tuberculosis from growing on host-derived fatty acids during persistent infection. Although ubiquitous in living organisms, FBAs can be divided into two classes which differ in their structure and reaction mechanism. While class I FBAs are the only type found in mammals, prokaryotes produce class II FBAs. The absence of class II FBAs from mammalian cells and the specificity of their structure and catalytic mechanism should make it possible to design specific inhibitors of class II enzymes that target pathogenic bacteria without affecting the host's gluconeogenetic and glycolytic pathways.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of ongoing high throughput primary experiments entitled, ""Absorbance-based biochemical primary high throughput screening assay to identify inhibitors of the aldolase of M. tuberculosis.""  This counterscreen is similar in format to the aforementioned assay with the only two following differences: (i) the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate substrate is replaced with glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate, a product of its conversion by FBA and (ii) no (FBA) is used. The counterscreen hence recapitulates the two steps involved in the monitoring of FBA activity through the conversion of FB into the triose product glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate (G3P), which would be converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by the helper enzyme triose phosphate isomerase (TPI). A second helper enzyme, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GDH), converts the dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate with the concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD, which is monitored by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm. In this new assay format, the A340 is independent of FBA activity, hence compounds that reduce absorbance at 340 nm are either absorbance artifacts or helper enzyme inhibitors that will not be pursued. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.78 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 5 uL /well of Buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10% Glycerol, pH8.0) supplemented with 400 nM ZnCl2,240 uM NADH and the helper enzymes GDH-TPI (4 U/mL) was dispensed into all wells of a 1536-well plate except the ""No enzyme"" wells that contained the same supplemented buffer but no GDH-TPI enzymes. Next, 48 nL of test compounds were then delivered in each well using a PinTool. The assay was then initiated by dispensing 5 uL of Buffer A supplemented with 240 uM of the substrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes before A340 was measured using the EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells treated with test compounds. Low_Control is defined as wells treated with DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells with no GDH-TPI enzyme.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-13, and for inactive compounds 13-0.

Description:  Chemotherapeutic agents that target estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and growth factor signaling systems have been extensively pursued and developed for a long time (1-4]). However, one of the most pressing limitations of currently established chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer is the fact that breast cancers frequently acquire resistance to antiestrogens (5, 6). Nuclear receptors (NR) and other hormone receptors mediate their cellular effects in part through the interaction with coactivators which increase their transcriptional activity. The best characterized coactivator family is the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (7). Given the central role that SRC-3 plays in breast and other cancers, the search for small molecule agents that target SRC-1 and SRC-3 represent an innovative and potentially effective strategy to identify agents to treat hormone-refractory breast cancers and other cancers where these coactivators are overexpressed. Compounds that target the function of steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) protein promise to be different because cancer cells are less likely to bypass the comprehensive disruption of multiple growth factor signaling systems that result from the loss of SRC-3 function. In contrast to the goal of screens that seek to interfere with NR-coactivator interactions, the work proposed here aims to identify compounds that specifically target the coactivators themselves. This approach offers to be more broadly applicable. For instance, SRC-1 or SRC-3 typically remains overexpressed in ER negative cancers or acts as a coactivator for other oncogenic transcription factors (8). SMIs that target ERa, on the other hand are largely predicted to duplicate the biological action of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen.  References:  1. Arteaga, C.L., A.K. Tandon, D.D.

In this assay, HEK293 cells are transfected with a GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid (pGL4.31, Promega) and an expression vector encoding SRC-3 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4(pBIND-SRC-3). The ability of compounds to reduce coactivator transcriptional activity is assessed by measuring luciferase expression from the reporter gene plasmid. As designed, compounds that inhibit SRC3 ability to induce transcription will lead to a decrease in expression of the luciferase gene, resulting in reduced well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Seven million HEK293 cells were seeded into T-175 flasks containing 23 mLs of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v Anti-Anti. Flasks were then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to the assay, cells were harvested using TrypLE, resuspended in fresh media at a density of 1 million cells per mL and seeded into new T-175 flasks (23 mL per flask). After allowed to attach for one hour at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, cells were transfected with 1 mL of preincubated mix of serum-free OptiMEM containing 23 ug of the pGL4.31 reporter plasmid, 2.3 ug of pBIND-SRC3 vector, and 80 uL of transfection reagents. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 750,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM media supplemented as described above.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of a white, solid-bottom 1536-well plate using a flying reagent dispenser (3,750 cells per well). The first two columns received cells transfected with reporter plasmid and an empty pBIND vector as a control for background luminescence. Cells were then treated with 18 nL/well of test compounds, DMSO as a negative control (final concentration 0.36%), or Gossypol as a positive control (36 uM final) using a PinTool transfer unit (GNF). Plates were then placed in the incubator at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. Twenty four hours later, plates were removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by adding 5 uL per well of ONE-Glo luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured using the ViewLux plate reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent inhibition of each test compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( median_positive_control - test_compound ) / ( median_positive_control - median_negative_control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound treated cells. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing Gossypol treated cells. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO treated cells.

As designed, compounds that inhibit SRC1 ability to induce transcription will lead to a decrease in expression of the luciferase gene, resulting in reduced well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Seven million HEK293 cells were seeded in T-175 flasks 23 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v Anti-Anti. Flasks were then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, cells were harvested using TrypLE, resuspended in fresh media at a density of 1 million cells per mL and seeded into new T-175 flasks (23 mL per flask). After being allowed to attach for one hour at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, cells were transfected with 1 mL of preincubated mix of serum-free OptiMEM containing 23 ug of pGL4.31 reporter plasmid, 2.3 ug of pBIND-SRC1 vector and 80 uL of transfection reagents. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 750,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM media supplemented as described above.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of a white, solid-bottom 1536-well plate using a flying reagent dispenser (i.e. 3,750 cells per well). The first two columns received cells transfected with the reporter plasmid and an empty pBIND vector as a control for background luminescence. Cells were then treated with 18 nL/well of test compounds, DMSO as a negative control (final concentration 0.36%) or Gossypol as a positive control (36 uM final) using a PinTool transfer unit (GNF). Plates were then placed in the incubator at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. Twenty four hours later, plates were removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase was detected by adding 5 uL per well of ONE-Glo luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minutes incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent inhibition of each test compound was calculated as follow:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( median_positive_control - test_compound ) / ( median_positive_control - median_negative_control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound treated cells. Positive_Control is defined as wells containing Gossypol treated cells. Negative_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO treated cells.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-63, and for inactive compounds 63-0.

The two primary forms of pemphigus, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are differentiated by the site of blistering. PF patient sera contain antibodies against Dsg1 and exhibit blistering of the skin whereas PV patient sera targets Dsg3 and results in suprabasilar blistering of the mucous membranes. Characteristic of pemphigus, sera either patient type can be shown by immunofluorescence to directly bind epithelial tissue. Studies using antibodies derived from patients that are passively transferred into neonatal mice or incubated with human epithelial tissue demonstrate that anti-Dsg antibodies are pathogenic, both IgG and its Fab' fragment causes loss of cell adhesion with the histology of pemphigus (2). However, not all anti-Dsg antibodies demonstrate pathogenic potential and epitope mapping studies suggest that the more pathogenic anti-Dsg antibodies bind to membrane-distal regions predicted to form the trans-adhesive interface between keratinocytes whereas non-pathogenic antibodies bind more membrane-proximal domains (3). These studies indicate that pathogenic antibodies alone can cause blister formation without the need for other inflammatory mediators.  Before the development of steroids, PV was a uniformly fatal disease. Current therapies, relying on generalized immunosuppression with corticosteroids and adjunctive, steroid-sparing agents as well as plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin, have led to reduced patient mortality. However, morbidity associated with the side effects of treatment is significant and underscores the need for therapies that specifically target pathogenic anti-Dsg antibodies. No such therapies exist and for such therapies to have generalized utility, PV patients would have to display a limited genetic diversity of pathogenic anti-Dsg antibodies. Recent data indicate that pathogenic anti-Dsg antibodies from different pemphigus patients share variable region sequences indicative of limited diversity and provide a proof of principle that small molecule reagents could be identified that block the binding of pathogenic mAbs to Dsg. We have used antibody phage display to clone anti-Dsg mAbs from PV and PF patients in the form of single chain variable fragments (scFv) that contain the heavy and light chain variable regions (4-7). These scFv recombinant antibodies bind epidermis either by injection into neonatal mice or by indirect immunofluorescence on tissue. Pathogenic anti-Dsg mAbs bind to a similar part of desmogleins (i.e. a calcium-stabilized conformational epitope at the amino-terminus which contains the adhesive site) and are blocked from binding to Dsg by pemphigus sera (4,5). These findings suggest that pathogenic antibodies from different patients bind at or near the same epitope. In addition, pathogenic mAbs block much of the binding of pemphigus sera to desmoglein, suggesting that they define a major portion of the antibody response in patients (5). Using these cloned reagents, we have developed a robust bead-based assay that quantifies antibody binding to Dsg and have validated and optimized its performance.","Protocol: 1)  Protein G beads (1.06 million beads per 384 well plate) are coupled with the DSG3 antigen by overnight incubation with a cell lysate containing an Fc-DSG3 construct. 2)  Coupled beads are used at 3000 beads per well 3)  scFv-GFP reagent is diluted in Assay buffer (PBS with 1mM CaCl2, 0.05% BSA, 0.01% Na Azide), added to 382 well assay plates, and incubated with a 20 microM solution of test compounds for 60 minutes at RT.  4)  Vehicle control (2%DMSO) and Blocking control (1/40 dilution of soluble DSG3 antigen) are similarly incubated with scFv-anti-DSG3-GFP 5)  Pre-coupled beads are added to each well and plates are incubated for 60 minutes with rotation 6)  scFv-anti-DSG3-GFP binding to beads is detected using flow cytometry and reported as the Median Channel Fluorescence       Calculations:  Z and Z' values were calculated individually for all plates, most plates passed a Z'>0.3.

Inhibition of extracellular PDI displayed on the surface of platelets and/or vascular cells prevents platelet accumulation and fibrin generation that leads to thrombus formation. Arterial thrombosis mediates tissue infarction in coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. PDI  is also involved in entry of HIV into the cell via PDI mediated cleavage of disulfide bonds in gp120.  An assay was set up to monitor and identify inhibitors of the PDI mediated aggregation of insulin. The assay measures aggregation of insulin chains by monitoring absorbance at 650 nm.  PDI cleaves disulfide bonds in  the beta chain of  insulin  causing them to aggregate.   When PDI is inhibited there is a decrease in aggregation and therefore a decrease in absorbance.  Expected Outcome: Active hits are determined as compounds that decrease absorbance by at least 30% as compared with the neutral controls."," Recombinant PDI produced in E.coli received from collaborator.

Fisher, M.Ph., Ph.D., Virginia Commonwealth University  Cancer is a progressive disease culminating in the acquisition of metastatic potential by a subset of evolving tumor cells. Although extensively investigated, the precise molecular events underlying tumor development and cancer progression remain unclear. Progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3), originally identified in rodents, displays elevated expression as cancers become more aggressive. The minimal promoter region controlling PEG-3 expression, PEG-Prom, has been isolated and shown to display elevated expression in a wide range of both human and rodent tumors, with minimal expression in normal cells. The PEG-Prom is transcriptionally activated following transformation by diverse acting oncogenes or as a consequence of unidentified genetic factors mediating cellular transformation. We have determined the mechanism for this selectivity and it involves transcription (gene regulatory) factors, AP-1 and PEA-3, which are expressed at elevated levels in virtually all rodent and human cancers. Moreover, in cases of cancer reversion or blocking expression of specific transforming oncogenes, PEG-Prom activity is decreased. In these contexts, the PEG-Prom represents a valuable predictive tool and readout to identify molecules with potential antitumor activity, without a priori identification of the genetic changes causative of the transformed/tumorigenic phenotype. The primary goal of this screen is to identify chemical inhibitors of the PEG-Promoter generated from high-throughput screening methods. These small molecule chemical probes might have potential anticancer properties and could provide a foundation for the development of novel antitumor drugs.  REFERENCES 1.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A,,,,HTS Assay for Peg3 Promoter Inhibitors,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A685-PEG3-Inh-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-09-23,,359521,6155,353366,359244,6145,353104,1.1,Live,cell-based format,reporter-gene assay,bioluminescence,,,

Hh signaling regulates cerebellar patterning by promoting the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells, and constitutive Hh target gene expression can lead to medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain tumor(1).  Hh signaling is normally initiated by the binding of Hh ligands to the twelve-pass transmembrane protein Ptch1(2) inducing its exit from the cilium, leading to Smo accumulation and activation within the antenna-like organelle.  Activated Smo then shifts the balance between repressor and activator forms of the Gli transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3) by promoting three events: their stabilization from proteolytic processing into N-terminal repressors (Gli2/3R), their conversion into transcriptional activators (Gli2/3A), and their accumulation at the distal tip of the cilium.  The process by which Smo regulates Gli function appears to involve the nucleocytoplasmic protein Sufu, which can directly inhibit the Gli proteins and facilitate their proteolysis.  The activator form of Gli2, and to a lesser extent that of Gli3, subsequently drives the expression of Hh target genes, including cell cycle regulators, oncogenes, Ptch1, and the constitutively active transcription factor Gli1. Oncogenic Hh pathway activation can be initiated at multiple points within the signaling mechanism described above.  As a GPCR-like signaling protein, Smo is perhaps the most ""druggable"" target within the Hh pathway, and Smo inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in murine tumor models(3-9) and human clinical trials(10,11).  The excitement generated by these findings is tempered by the emergence of GDC-0449-resistant tumors, which either contain point mutations in Smo that prevent drug binding or sustain Hh target gene expression in a Smo-independent manner(11). Tumors expressing GDC-0449-resistant Smo were also insensitive to cyclopamine, a structurally distinct Smo inhibitor(12), suggesting that the development of additional Smo antagonists will not be an adequate solution to this problem. Moreover, certain cancers such as Ewing's sarcoma and KRAS-induced pancreatic adenocarcinoma can proliferate in response to Gli activation through non canonical mechanisms(13-17).  Chemical inhibitors that act downstream of Smo therefore constitute an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Hh pathway-dependent cancers.  Due to the high susceptibility of Smo to small-molecule modulation, high-throughput screens using Hh ligand-stimulated cells are overwhelmingly dominated by Smo antagonists(18)   This lead discovery project employs a cell-based reporter that lacks Sufu and exhibits constitutive Hh target gene expression in response to endogenous Gli activators in order to find Smo-independent modulators of Hh pathway. The Sufu-KO-LIGHT cells used for this project rely on endogenous rather than overexpressed Gli for greater sensitivity toward the goal of identifying non-Smo Gli antagonists.  In this cell-based luminescent reporter assay, Smo-independent Hh gene activity is monitored in Sufu-KO-LIGHT cells through a co-transfection of eight tandem Gli-binding sites with a firefly luciferase reporter construct driven by Gli.

Chemical probe ML359 was developed and reported in AID 588521.","Keywords: V. cholerae, cqsA, luxS mutant, quorum sensing, luminescence Assay Overview: A modified strain of Vibrio cholerae used in this assay uses light production to signal quorum sensing.  Vibrio cholerae is not naturally bioluminescent but the closely related species, Vibrio harveyi, produces light when the population is at a high density (i.e. a quorum is sensed). In the V. cholerae BH1578 strain, the V. harveyi luxCDABE (luciferase) operon was introduced as a cosmid and the operon is activated by endogenous mechanisms to elicit light upon reaching a quorum.  In addition, the BH1578 strain is a cqsA, luxS double mutant that lacks both autoinducer synthases (CAI-1 and AI-2). BH1578 does not generate light in the absence of exogenous autoinducers but bioluminescence can be stimulated up to 10,000-fold by adding 1 uM (saturating) CAI-1.  Bacteria are plated into 384 well plates and compound is added by the pin transfer method. CAI-1 will be used as the positive control. In addition to luminescence, the confluency of each well is measured at an absorbance of 600 nM.  Expected Outcome: Molecules that induce light production in BH1578 in the absence of exogenous autoinducers will register as hits in this assay. As a reminder of the rationale for the screen, the accumulation of autoinducers normally represses virulence factor expression and biofilm formation in V. cholerae."," Vibrio cholerae quorum-sensing modulator bioassay Reporter strain: 1.BH1578 (V. cholerae AcqsA AluxQ carrying pBB1 cosmid, which contains the V. harveyi luxCDABE luciferase operon) Materials: LB Medium: Dissolve in 10 g/L Tryptone, 5 g/L Yeast Extract, and 10 g/L NaCl in distilled water, autoclave, store at room temperature Tetracycline (10 mg/mL): Dissolve 10 mg tetracycline in 1 mL 100% ethanol, store at -20 degrees C, protect from light LB/tet: add 1 mL tetracycline (10 mg/mL) to 1L of LB medium.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  increasing readout signal. NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Stimulators Minus Neutral Controls' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3): The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0. The median raw signal of the intraplate positive control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 100. Experimental wells values were scaled to this range. PATTERN CORRECTION:  No plate pattern correction algorithm from Genedata Condoseo (v.7.0.3) was applied.

Such reversible epigenetic silencing is a key pathway resulting in loss-of-function phenotypes that promote the growth of many cancers. Examples of genes that have undergone hypermethylation-induced silencing include the genes encoding the cell cycle regulator proteins pIS and p16, the pro-apoptotic effector gene Apaf-1, the mismatch DNA repair gene MLH1, and GSTP1 that codes for the phase 2 enzyme glutathione S-transferase [1, 2, 4-9]. Thus, inhibitors of MTase enzymes have the demonstrated potential for reversing hypermethylation-induced silencing and are exciting new targets for epigenetic cancer therapies [3, 8, 10, 11]. Maintenance of genomic methylation patterns is mediated primarily by DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). This biochemical molecular beacon assay employs a fluorescent readout based on the ability of the DNMT1 methyltransferase to methylate hemi-methylated duplex DNA oligo substrate, thus protecting it from being cut by the coupled Hinp1i restriction endonuclease.

Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41-aa peptide that has been shown to induce various behavioral changes related to adaptation to stress. The CRF system, including the CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP) and the CRF receptors, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, are thought to contribute, to the physiological adaptations that result from stress. It has been shown that CRF interaction with CRF-BP may positively modulate CRF-R2 function and, further that when CRF binds to the CRF-BP, it modulates CRF-R2 signaling and contributes to stress-induced relapse to drug seeking. It has been further shown that the CRF-BP-CRF-R2 receptor complex is a novel therapeutic target that may be valuable for the prevention of relapse to cocaine use (Ungless et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005). However, the potential for the CRF-BP-CRF-R2 receptor complex has not been realized, as there are few research tools available or any non-peptidyl ligands commercially available that target the CRF-BP-CRF-R2 receptor complex. Previous attempts have been made to obtain small molecule agonists of the CRF-BP with limited success in part due to autocatalytic activity within CRF-BP making it extremely difficult to successfully purify in sufficient quantities. To address this problem, we developed an innovative cell-based assay where CRF-BP is expressed and tethered extracellularly by being fused with CRF-receptor 2 (CRF-R2). This has overcome the need to make and purify CRF-BP and has facilitated the development of a simple fluorescence calcium assay amenable to high throughput screening. Thus, the aim of this assay is to identify a chemical series of ligands and compounds that positively modulate the interaction between CRF-BP and CRF-R2. In the past, this has been difficult due to an inability to develop a suitable high throughput assay for screening against CRF-BP. To address this problem, an innovative and novel fluorescence based calcium assay was developed where CRF-BP is expressed and tethered at the cell surface in a heterodimeric complex with CRF-R2. This greatly facilitated our ability to find molecules that enhance CRF-R2 activation in the presence and absence of CRF-BP. This innovation forms the basis of the high-throughput assay that we have optimized for chemical library screening.  The high-throughput screen described here will enable us to readily identify small molecules that act as agonists of the CRF-R2-CRF-BP complex.

Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) is a 41-aa peptide that has been shown to induce various behavioral changes related to adaptation to stress. The CRF system, including the CRF-binding protein (CRF-BP) and the CRF receptors, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, are thought to contribute, to the physiological adaptations that result from stress. It has been shown that CRF interaction with CRF-BP may positively modulate CRF-R2 function and, further that when CRF binds to the CRF-BP, it modulates CRF-R2 signaling and contributes to stress-induced relapse to drug seeking. It has been further shown that the CRF-BP-CRF-R2 receptor complex is a novel therapeutic target that may be valuable for the prevention of relapse to cocaine use (Ungless et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005). However, the potential for the CRF-BP-CRF-R2 receptor complex has not been realized, as there are few research tools available or any non-peptidyl ligands commercially available that target the CRF-BP-CRF-R2 receptor complex. Previous attempts have been made to obtain small molecule antagonists of the CRF-BP with limited success in part due to autocatalytic activity within CRF-BP making it extremely difficult to successfully purify in sufficient quantities. To address this problem, we developed an innovative cell-based assay where CRF-BP is expressed and tethered extracellularly by being fused with CRF-receptor 2 (CRF-R2). This has overcome the need to make and purify CRF-BP and has facilitated the development of a simple fluorescence calcium assay amenable to high throughput screening. Thus, the aim of this assay is to identify a chemical series of ligands and compounds that inhibit the interaction between CRF-BP and CRF-R2. In the past, this has been difficult due to an inability to develop a suitable high throughput assay for screening against CRF-BP. To address this problem, an innovative and novel fluorescence based calcium assay was developed where CRF-BP is expressed and tethered at the cell surface in a heterodimeric complex with CRF-R2. This greatly facilitated our ability to find molecules that prevent CRF-R2 activation in the presence and absence of CRF-BP. This innovation forms the basis of the high-throughput assay that we have optimized for chemical library screening.  The high-throughput screen described here will enable us to readily identify small molecules that act as antagonists of the CRF-R2-CRF-BP complex. Inhibition of the CRF-R2-CRF-BP complex will be detected through the measurement of changes in intracellular calcium via fluorescent calcium sensitive dyes.","A.

It is managed at multiple levels: mRNA expression, mRNA translation initiation and mRNA decay (1). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression to control a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, division and differentiation, as well as metabolism and development.  The poly(A) tail of mRNA is bound by several molecules of the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), an abundant cytoplasmic protein in eukaryotes that promotes translation (2). PABPC1 is a multi-domain protein that contains four phylogenetically conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRM1-4) (3,4) a proline-rich unstructured region and a 70-residue C-terminal domain termed Mlle or PABC (5). Mlle (Mademoiselle) refers to the conserved KITGMLLE signature motif of this domain. The Mlle domain binds proteins with a 12-15 amino acid motif termed PAM2 to regulate PABPC1 involvement in mRNA decay. The goal of this grant is to screen for small molecule modulators of Mlle interactions as chemical probes for the study of PABP regulation in translation and mRNA silencing. This will open new therapeutic opportunities for altering gene expression in cancer, neurodegeneration, and other diseases.  REFERENCES 1. Sonenberg N, Hinnebusch AG.

It is precipitated by acute rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque leading to thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. The sudden cessation of blood flow leads within hours to massive death of heart muscle cells by apoptosis and necrosis1. Prompt myocardial reperfusion via angioplasty/stenting is currently the optimal treatment, but its effectiveness is limited by a narrow therapeutic time window2,3. Work over the past 25 years in lower organisms and mammals has led to the recognition that a significant portion of cell death - both apoptosis and necrosis - occurs in a deliberate and highly regulated manner4,5. This discovery has prompted re-examination of the possibility that cell death during myocardial infarction can be manipulated. It is hoped that the proposed work will provide the basis for the development of a drug to limit the size of myocardial infarction and/or decrease its speed of progression. it is critical to model both the ischemic and reperfusion phases of myocardial infarction (""ischemia-reperfusion"") in a cell-based system.  Hydrogen peroxide models the oxidative stress of reperfusion (reperfusion phase), while 2-deoxy-D-glucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, simulates the metabolic stress of ischemia (ischemic phase). While other death stimuli operate during myocardial infarction in vivo, oxidative stress and the metabolic stress of ischemia would be considered the two most critical of these pathophysiological events in ""acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction"".

Ubiquitin is covalently attached via an enzymatic cascade to target proteins through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of the acceptor substrate [1]. Assembly of a chain of >=4 ubiquitins linked together via Lys48 of ubiquitin marks cellular proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome [2-3].  The 26S proteasome is a 2.5 megadalton macromolecular protein complex that comprises two distinct subparticles: the 19S cap regulatory particle (RP) and the 20S core particle (CP) [4]. The AAA ATPases of the 19S cap are thought to use the mechanical energy from ATP hydrolysis in order to drive substrate denaturation/unfolding [2], and substrate translocation into the 20S CP [3]. Concomitant with substrate degradation, the ubiquitin chain was previously shown to be cleaved from the target protein by the Rpn11 subunit of the 19S lid [5-6]. Rpn11 is a member of an unusual family of deubiquitinating enzymes that employ a novel zinc metalloprotease active site - the JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) motif - to cleave isopeptide bonds [7]. The de-ubiquitination catalyzed by Rpn11 is essential for the protein-degrading activity of the proteasome [6]. Rpn11 metalloprotease thus represents a new proteasome activity that can potentially be targeted by small molecules to block degradation of proteasome substrates and stem the growth of human tumors.  This biochemical assay employs a fluorescent polarization readout based on the ability of the 26S proteasome to cleave the protein substrate comprising four tandem ubiquitins fused to a peptide bearing a unique cysteine labeled with a fluorophore. Cleavage of this substrate by Rpn11 at the junction between the fourth ubiquitin and the peptide releases the low molecular weight fluorescent peptide, resulting in depolarization of the fluorophore.

Within the larger set of proteases, pharmaceutical development for the proteases of the two-part bacterial toxins of Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus anthracis is of great interest due to their role in natural disease and biothreat scenarios (1-4). No effective pharmaceutical treatment currently exists for any type of botulinum toxin poisoning. Though potential approaches exist for vaccine-based treatments, these are rendered useless once the toxin enters the cell (2), which makes development of a small molecule treatment highly desirable. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the BoNT/F LC that is required for the intracellular toxicity of the botulinum neurotoxin (C. botulinum) have excellent potential for treatment of effects of botulism (2). As BoNT poisoning remains a real world concern due to natural disease, potential use as a weapon of mass destruction, and increasing (e.g. BoTox) use as pharmaceuticals, effective treatments for these deadly toxins remain an important yet elusive goal (2).  The purpose of this proposal is to discover novel small molecule compounds that inhibit BoNTFLC protease. We are seeking to identify compounds that could affect protease activity through alteration of interactions with required domains distal from the cleavage site. Identification of such a novel allosteric inhibitor would truly be state-of-the-art over current active site protease inhibitors. Therefore, we have developed a screening approach that uses full-length substrates attached to microspheres that can detect molecules that either inhibit at the catalytic site or at known required sites distal to the cleavage site.  This project will be run in a multiplex HTS with Botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain proteases(BoNTALC) and Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (LF).","This assay will be used to identify small molecule inhibitors of Botulinum toxin type A and F light chain proteases (BoNTALC and BoNTFLC) and inhibitors of Bacillus anthracis Lethal Factor protease (LF) in a multiplex format. Proteases that are not inhibited will cleave their substrates and produce a loss of signal effect. If the proteases are inhibited by a small molecule cleavage will not occur, thus the signal should stay the same. Full length protease substrates are used in order to detect inhibitors that act at either the protease catalytic site or at sites of protease interaction with substrate distal to the cleavage site.  Protease inhibition assays were performed as previously described (5), but with modifications. Biotinylated GFP protease substrates for LF, BoNTALC, BoNTFLC, and a protease-resistant substrate (pinpointGFP) were prepared and loaded on color-coded streptavidin microspheres (Spherotech Blue Array Particle kit, 5.1 microm diameter) as previously described (5-7). Additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1st, 4 microL protease buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Tween-20, pH 7.4); 2nd, 2 microL of a mixture of 1.5 microM LF, 5 nM BoNTALC and 375 nM BoNTFLC in protease buffer; 3rd, 100 nL of test compounds (1 mM in DMSO); and 4th, 4 microL containing 2x10;5/ml of each set of microspheres. Plates were sealed and incubated at 24 degreesC overnight (16-18 h), rotating continuously from inverted to upright position until analyzed in 1536 well plate format with the HyperCyt Cluster Cytometer platform the following day.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing protease buffer alone (PCntrl, positive control) or the protease mixture alone (NCntrl, negative control). Additional positive controls included Ebselen, VAMP peptide and IN-2-LF (selective inhibitors of BoNTALC, BoNTFLC and LF, respectively), which were added separately and together as a mixture to validate protease inhibition. In each well the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined for each set of substrate-bearing microspheres. A fifth streptavidin microsphere set included in each well had no GFP moiety attached and was used to quantify the contribution of innate test compound fluorescence to the assay readout. All MFI values for substrate-bearing microspheres were corrected by subtraction of the MFI value for the substrate-free microspheres in the same well.  Test compound inhibition of substrate cleavage by protease was then calculated as 100 x (MFI:Test - Mean MFI:NCntrl)/(Mean MFI:PCntrl - Mean MFI:NCntrl) in which MFI:Test represents corrected MFI in the presence of test compound, and Mean MFI:PCntrl and MFI:NCntrl represent means for replicate MFI determinations in control wells.

Botulinum Neurotoxin A Light Chain (BoNTALC) is also an active component of Botulinum Neurotoxin type A (BoNTA), which has become a widely used pharmaceutical (BoTox) that has important uses in the treatment of many diseases. Thus, discovery of BoNTALC inhibitors is also of interest due to the potential of both accidental and intentional misuse of BoTox.  The use of BoNT as a potential biological weapon and the role that BoNTA has in naturally caused botulism has driven much effort in pharmaceutical development targeting BoNTALC. In the USA, serotype A causes >50% of all cases of naturally occurring botulism. While naturally occurring food borne botulism is usually not fatal, symptoms can last for several months. Advances in hygiene and food processing have largely eliminated food borne botulism as a major public health concern but outbreaks still occur in the U.S. No effective pharmaceutical treatment currently exists for any type of botulinum toxin poisoning. The currently approved treatment for adult BoNTA poisoning is administration of equine antibodies to BoNTA, which cause serious side effects and have a short window of application. In the specialized case of infant botulism, caused by colonization of the large intestine by C. botulinum, a human anti-sera treatment has been approved for use in patients less than 1 year old. Though the available antitoxins provide some effective treatments for natural disease, they are expensive, require refrigeration, and would be difficult to administer in large-scale outbreaks.

This project will be run in a multiplex HTS with Botulinum neurotoxin types A and F light chain proteases(BoNTALC and BoNTFLC).","This assay will be used to identify small molecule inhibitors of Botulinum toxin type A and F light chain proteases (BoNTALC and BoNTFLC) and inhibitors of Bacillus anthracis Lethal Factor protease (LF) in a multiplex format. Proteases that are not inhibited will cleave their substrates and produce a loss of signal effect. If the proteases are inhibited by a small molecule cleavage will not occur, thus the signal should stay the same. Full length protease substrates are used in order to detect inhibitors that act at either the protease catalytic site or at sites of protease interaction with substrate distal to the cleavage site.  Protease inhibition assays were performed as previously described (5), but with modifications. Biotinylated GFP protease substrates for LF, BoNTALC, BoNTFLC, and a protease-resistant substrate (pinpointGFP) were prepared and loaded on color-coded streptavidin microspheres (Spherotech Blue Array Particle kit, 5.1 microm diameter) as previously described (5-7). Additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1st, 4 microL protease buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Tween-20, pH 7.4); 2nd, 2 microL of a mixture of 1.5 microM LF, 5 nM BoNTALC and 375 nM BoNTFLC in protease buffer; 3rd, 100 nL of test compounds (1 mM in DMSO); and 4th, 4 microL containing 2x10;5/ml of each set of microspheres. Plates were sealed and incubated at 24 degreesC overnight (16-18 h), rotating continuously from inverted to upright position until analyzed in 1536 well plate format with the HyperCyt Cluster Cytometer platform the following day.  The assay response range was defined by replicate control wells containing protease buffer alone (PCntrl, positive control) or the protease mixture alone (NCntrl, negative control). Additional positive controls included Ebselen, VAMP peptide and IN-2-LF (selective inhibitors of BoNTALC, BoNTFLC and LF, respectively), which were added separately and together as a mixture to validate protease inhibition. In each well the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined for each set of substrate-bearing microspheres. A fifth streptavidin microsphere set included in each well had no GFP moiety attached and was used to quantify the contribution of innate test compound fluorescence to the assay readout. All MFI values for substrate-bearing microspheres were corrected by subtraction of the MFI value for the substrate-free microspheres in the same well.  Test compound inhibition of substrate cleavage by protease was then calculated as 100 x (MFI:Test - Mean MFI:NCntrl)/(Mean MFI:PCntrl - Mean MFI:NCntrl) in which MFI:Test represents corrected MFI in the presence of test compound, and Mean MFI:PCntrl and MFI:NCntrl represent means for replicate MFI determinations in control wells.

Description:  Recent discovery of TMEM16A which encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) has provided a new pathway to identify novel small molecule probes [1-9] for this important and elusive target. Abnormality of CaCC activity is thought to be causal or linked to several major diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and hypertension. Its roles are implicated in numerous physiological processes including cardiac and neuronal excitation, sensory transduction, trans-epithelial secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and fertilization.  Discovery of CaCC-specific chemical probes can provide not only useful tool molecules for pharmacological interrogation of the CaCC function and diversity, but may also provide compounds as starting points for therapeutic efforts to treat various diseases resulting from dysfunction in chloride transport.   Our objective is to find potent and specific small molecule chemical probes that modulate TMEM16A-based calcium-activated chloride channel, by performing a primary screen of the MLSMR library of 300,000 compounds to identify small molecules and structural scaffolds that modulate this calcium-activated chloride channel; and examining and identifying hits with preferential effects on TMEM16A versus other chloride channels after validation, confirmatory and counter-screens.  Despite the discovery of the molecular identity of CaCC, it is broadly recognized that there are only few limited CaCC/TMEM16A inhibitors/blockers available. Only until recently that CaCC (TMEM16A) modulators have been reported (10-12), including 1) Niflumic acid (non-specific, 17 uM, PMID: 18959787); 2) 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (Non-specific; 10.3uM); 3) 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB, Non-specific, 22-68 uM); ;4) DIDS (Non-specific, 48/10.7 uM, PMID18959787); 5) Flufenamic acid (N-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)anthranilic acid, Non-specific, 28 uM); 6) Digallic acid (TMEM16A; 3.6 uM, PMID: 20581223; 21084298); 7) Tannic acid (TMEM16A, 6.1uM, PMID: 20581223; 21084298); and 8) T16Ainh-A01 (TMEM16A, 1.1uM, PMID: 20581223; 21084298). Most are non-specific inhibitors and were discovered without the information of the molecular identity of the CaCCs, except the last three in the table which were reported after the current application. Still, potent and specific CaCC inhibitors are in need.  Principle of the assay  The iodide ion, which is permeable through the TMEM16A channel, serves as a surrogate for Cl-flux. The iodide flux is detected by YFP Iodide Biosensors (YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L)(13). The activation of the TMEM16A by ionomycin (or ATP) triggers the channel opening and I- influx, and consequentially the quenching of the mutant YFP fluorescence. Any compounds which inhibit/block the TMEM16A channels will result in reduced quenching and higher remaining fluorescence as detected by imaging plate reader FDSS (14).    Assay overview:  The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that inhibit/block the calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A). This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses TMEM16A channels. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular iodide, as monitored by a iodide-sensitive fluorescent protein YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing TMEM16A channels were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with assay buffer after removing media. Compounds were added to the assay buffer. Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and fluorescence changes measured upon the addition of trigger solution (0.5 uM ionomycin in 16 mM iodide final in the well). The fluorescence of YFP was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated YFP fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an inhibitor/blocker of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels.

Its activity can be measured through an enzyme coupling assay. Due to the requirement of two coupling enzymes, potential interference caused by the low wavelength of detection and low enzyme activity, a fluorescence polarization displacement assay has been developed as an alternative for high-throughput screening to identify active-site directed FadD28 inhibitors. This assay involves displacement of a fluorescence labeled ligand, a TAMRA labeled substrate, by a small molecule from FadD28. 5""-O-[N-(Tetradecanoyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine, a mimic of the intermediate acyl-adenylate, was selected as the ligand based on its potency and solubility. In fluorescence polarization, the degree of polarization of the fluorescent ligand is related to its rotational correlation time and hence molecular mass. When a fluorophore is excited with polarized light, the emitted light is also polarized. When a fluorescent ligand is bound to a high molecular weight receptor, such as FadD28, it tumbles slowly and the emitted light remains largely polarized. However, when this ligand is displaced from FadD28 into solution by a competitive small molecule, the fluorescent ligand tumbles rapidly and the emitted light is depolarized. For analysis of ligand dissociation constants, anisotropy is more convenient to use than polarization values, consequently we will use anisotropy for data analysis rather than polarization in this FP displacement assay.  Expected Outcome: Active compounds or inhibitors will compete with TAMRA labeled substrate for the binding to FadD28. The competition is evidenced by a decrease of anisotropy signal.  The total fluorescence will be evaluated as well to eliminate false positive due to compound fluorescence interference.","Protocol: The FadD28 is purified through Ni-NTA affinity column due to a 6x Histidine tag.

This is the first time that tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors are being proposed to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). STriatal-Enriched Phosphatase (STEP) is a brain-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase that is highly expressed in regions where consolidation of memory occurs and regulates the internalization of NMDARs. Our recent work demonstrates that STEP is elevated in the prefrontal cortex of human AD patients and in animal models of AD. Moreover, using genetic manipulations to reduce STEP activity in a triple transgenic AD mouse model, we showed that a decrease in STEP levels attenuates the cognitive and cellular deficits observed in six-month old 3xTg-AD mice. The hypothesis that STEP inhibitors may prove therapeutic for the treatment of AD is a shift in the current paradigm of reducing A-beta levels to inhibiting a downstream target of A-beta. Recent data suggest that STEP inhibitors may prove therapeutic for this devastating disorder.  The goal of this high-throughput assay is to identify hit compounds for the STriatal-Enriched Phosphatase (STEP). This is accomplished via an enzymatic reaction utilizing a fluorogenic phosphatase substrate.","STEP Assay HTS Protocol  A.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 5 isoform a,,,,uHTS identification of small molecule inhibitors of Striatal-Enriched Phosphatase via a fluorescence intensity assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A754-STEP-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-10-24,,359521,889,358632,359244,887,358357,1.1,Live,single protein format,direct enzyme activity assay,fluorescence intensity,,,

Primary sensory neurons in DRG play an essential role in generating pain and itch by detecting painful or itchy stimuli through their peripheral axons in the skin and sending signals to the spinal cord via their central axons.   Several complementary lines of evidence suggest that Mrgs function as endogenous inhibitors of persistent pain [1]. Particularly, spinal cord application of BAM8-22 in mice strongly inhibited the wind-up response of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the spinal cord, and significantly attenuated inflammatory hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain in an Mrg-dependent manner. BAM8-22, a 15 amino acid endogenous peptide, is a specific agonist for mouse MrgC11 and human MrgX1 [2, 3]. Agonists [4, 5] for Mrgs may represent a new class of anti-hyperalgesics for chronic pain, which could suppress central sensitization via peripheral modulation, thereby inhibiting chronic pain without side effects in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the dual effect of BAM8-22 (i.e. inducing itch in the skin and blocking chronic pain in the spinal cord) is analogous to that of morphine (i.e. blocking pain and inducing itch).   The major goal of this project is to carry out a large-scale screen of small molecular compounds for antagonists, agonists, and allosteric modulators of human MrgX1 with therapeutic implications of anti-itch and anti-chronic pain.  Principle of the assay  The principle of the assay is based on that MrgX1 is potently and specifically activated by BAM8-22 (specific peptide agonist) which evokes a large rise in intracellular Ca2+. A three-addition scheme has been established for the multiplex screening of different kinds of modulators in one screen by three additions: 1) 1st addition for drug (library) itself for agonists, as well as an intrinsic counter screen to overcome common non-specificity of the calcium flux assays. 2) 2nd addition: addition of EC10 to EC30 of BAM8-22 for screen of allosteric agonist. 3) 3rd addition: addition of EC90 to ECmax of BAM8-22 for screen of antagonists/allosteric antagonists.  Assay overview:  The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that act as an agonist for MrgX1. This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses MrgX1 protein. The cells, which loaded with fluorescent dye-Flou4 NW,  are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of calcium flux.. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing MrgX1 were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with Fluo4-NW solution at 37 C for 30min and at RT for 30. min after removing media. 10 uM Compounds were added to the assay buffer with dye and recorded the change of  fluorescence by Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.  Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated fluorescence ratio. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an agonist of the MrgX1 protein.

Description:  Chromosome translocations that join the BCR and ABL1 (a.k.a. c-Abl) genes give rise to BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins causative in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and occasionally other myeloproliferative disorders (1). In addition, ETV6 forms fusion oncogenes with ABL1 (2) and the closely related ABL2 (a.k.a. Arg) (3) in some leukemias. ABL proteins are non-receptor tyrosine kinases normally under tight regulation, but BCR-ABL1 fusions are constitutively active. The ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (a.k.a. STI571 or Gleevec) is an effective treatment for CML (4), demonstrating that direct oncoprotein targeting can be used to manage cancer and perhaps eventually be part of a curative therapy. Some leukemias with activated ABL oncoproteins do not respond to imatinib, however, and for CML patients who do respond there is a significant risk of developing resistance due to strong selective pressure for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations that block inhibitor action (5). Resistance and relapse are even more common in BCR-ABL1 positive ALL. Some attempts have been made to circumvent resistance by reducing BCR-ABL1 expression (6, 7) or stability (8, 9) or by targeting collaborative signaling pathways (10-12). A more direct approach for improving treatment would be to maintain focus on reducing tyrosine kinase activity by targeting oncogenic ABL outside the catalytic site. RIN1 is a RAS effector protein that binds to and activates ABL tyrosine kinases (13, 14). Signaling is initiated by low affinity binding of a proline rich sequence on RIN1 to the SH3 domain of ABL. This interaction leads to phosphorylation of RIN1 on tyrosine 36, which subsequently associates with the ABL SH2 domain. The resulting stable divalent interaction (RIN1 proline-rich motif and phospho-Tyr36 bound to ABL SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively) relieves the ABL autoinhibitory fold and leads to activation of the ABL kinase through enhanced catalytic efficiency (13). Both ABL1 and ABL2 are activated by RIN1, and this requires only the ABL SH3, SH2 and kinase domains. Activation by RIN1 is independent of ABL trans-phosphorylation and is unaffected by an imatinib-resistance mutation (13). Silencing of RIN1 results in less tyrosine phosphorylation of the ABL substrate CRKL, and deletion of the mouse Rin1 gene causes reduction in basal levels of phospho-CRKL (14). These data demonstrate that RIN1 directly stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL proteins and is required for maintaining normal ABL kinase activity. Because human ABL fusion oncoproteins consistently retain the autoinhibitory SH3 and SH2 domains, we reasoned that these constitutively active tyrosine kinases might still be subject to positive regulation by RIN1. Indeed, RIN1 binds to and enhances the catalytic, transforming and leukemogenic properties of BCR-ABL1. Deletion of RIN1 blocked transformation of bone marrow cells by BCR-ABL1 and ETV6-ABL1. Transformation was rescued by ectopic RIN1, indicating a cell autonomous mechanism. BCR-ABL1T315I, a drug resistant mutant found in CML patients, was also dependent on RIN1 for transformation. Silencing of RIN1 in human leukemia cells reduced phospho-tyrosine levels and sensitized cells to imatinib. The dependence of BCR-ABL1 on a directly binding regulator (RIN1) provides a unique point of vulnerability that could be exploited to treat kinase inhibitor-resistant leukemias. In addition, combining drugs that inhibit BCR-ABL1 activation by RIN1 with standard ABL kinase inhibitors could provide therapy that is more efficacious and less prone to resistance and disease relapse. Finally, the concept of interference with positive regulators may be applicable to the targeted therapy of other oncogenic kinases.  References:  1.      Wong, S. and O.N.

This biochemical TRFRET-based assay employs RIN1-SBP and ABL1-GFP fusion proteins as binding partners, whose interaction is monitored using strep-Terbium (Tb). Preincubation of the fusion proteins allows tyrosine phosphorylation of RIN1-SBP by ABL1-GFP, and leads to formation of a stable complex. A streptavidin-complexed lanthanide (Tb) attaches to the streptavidin-binding-peptide (SBP) tag on RIN1. When excited, Tb transfers energy to a GFP tag on ABL1, now complexed with RIN1-SBP. As designed, a compound that acts as an inhibitor of the RIN1::ABL1 interaction will prevent either phosphorylation of RIN1-SBP and/or inhibit RIN-ABL complex formation, leading to reduced energy transfer and reduced well FRET (GFP emission / Tb emission). Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.35 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of Control Mix in assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 500 uM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 100 uM Na3VO4 and 100 uM BSA) containing 100 nM of ABL-eGFP and 2.5 nM of Terbium-Streptavidin into columns 1 thru columns 3 of 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 5 uL of Experimental Mix containing 100 nM of ABL-eGFP, 2.5 nM Terbium-Streptavidin and 100 nM of RIN1-SBP in assay buffer were dispensed into columns 4 thru 48. Then, the plates were centrifuged and pinned with 37 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.73% final concentration). The plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 25 C and TR-FRET was measured on a Viewlux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 495 nm and 525 nm. For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I525nm / I495nm  Where:  I525nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 525 nm. I495nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 495 nm.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * (Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing the Experimental Mix in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing the Control Mix and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing the Experimental Mix and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of low control wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values for each assay plate was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-4, and for inactive compounds 16-0.

This screen will identify specific compounds that target the 3'UTR of Shn3 to post-transcriptionally regulate its mRNA to reduce Shn3 protein levels. This assay uses a SV40 large T antigen-transformed osteoblast cell line (Clone20-Shn3FFL) that maintains the characteristics of primary osteoblasts and expresses a reporter construct driven by the EF1alpha promoter that generates a transcript which encodes for the firefly luciferase gene fused to the 3'UTR of Shn3. This cell line also contains a second ""control"" reporter construct that is also under the control of an EF1alpha promoter generating a transcript that encodes for the renilla luciferase gene fused to a control 3'UTR. Compounds of interest identified in this screen would reduce the levels of firefly luciferase without altering the levels of the control renilla luciferase (to be measure in a secondary screen). Compounds that reduce both firefly and renilla luciferase in this assay could be: 1) non-specifically targeting 3;UTRs; 2) repressors of the EF1alpha promoter; or 3) cytotoxic. Such compounds are not of interest and will not be pursued further.  Cell assay plates will be normalized against a positive control compound which was identified in the pilot screen.

Cells are plated at a concentration of 3000 cells per well in 30ul of OB media using a Combi Multidrop (Thermo) in white opaque 384-well plates (Corning 3570/8867BC). 3. Once plated, cells are incubated overnight at 37 degrees C 5% CO2 95% humidity prior to the addition of compounds. 4. Compounds are then be added to plates at a volume of 100nl of compound using a steel pin tool (V&P Scientific). 5. Following the addition of compounds, cells will be incubated for an additional 24 hours at 37 degrees C 5%CO2 95% humidity. 6. After 24 hour incubation period, cells and luciferase reagents are allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 10 minutes. 7. For firefly luciferase assay, 20ul of Cell Titer Glo luciferase (Promega) is added to each well with a Combi multidrop and then plates are incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature on orbital shaker. 8. Plates are read on an Envision multi-mode plate reader (Perkin Elmer) to obtain luminescence readings (0.1 s/well)","PRESENCE OF CONTROLS: Neutral control wells (NC) and positive control wells (PC) were included on every plate.  EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  decreasing readout signal.  NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3): The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0. The median raw signal of the intraplate positive control wells was set to a normalized activity value of -100. Experimental wells values were scaled to this range. All well activities were then multiplied by -1 to create a positive activity readout value range, to match Pubchem convention.   PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)' in Genedata (v7.0.3) was applied to the normalized plate data.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE: This was set as equal to the mean of the  normalized and corrected  sample replicate activities, rounded to the nearest integer . The minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE required for a compound to be called a hit (the activity threshold, or AT) was set at 75.  PERCENTAGE OF ACTIVE REPLICATES: For each sample, the percentage of replicates (PCT_ACTIVE_REP) which had activity scores >= AT was determined. The minimum percentage of replicates required for a compound to be called a hit (PAR_T) was set at 100.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME: Samples passing BOTH threshold criteria were assigned an outcome of 2 (active): PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE >= AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP >= PAR_T  Samples passing NEITHER threshold criteria were assigned an outcome of 1 (inactive): PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE < AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP < PAR_T  Samples passing AT only were assigned an outcome of 3 (inconclusive) : PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE >= AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP < PAR_T",,,,,Schnurri-3 Inhibitors: specific inducers of adult bone formation Measured in Cell-Based System Using Plate Reader - 2134-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity_Set2,Broad Institute,2134-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity_Set2,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-10-25,,357287,1846,355143,356883,1841,354752,1.2,Live,,,,cell-based format,reporter-gene assay,bioluminescence

Primary sensory neurons in DRG play an essential role in generating pain and itch by detecting painful or itchy stimuli through their peripheral axons in the skin and sending signals to the spinal cord via their central axons.   Several complementary lines of evidence suggest that Mrgs function as endogenous inhibitors of persistent pain [1]. Particularly, spinal cord application of BAM8-22 in mice strongly inhibited the wind-up response of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the spinal cord, and significantly attenuated inflammatory hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain in an Mrg-dependent manner. BAM8-22, a 15 amino acid endogenous peptide, is a specific agonist for mouse MrgC11 and human MrgX1 [2, 3]. Agonists[4,5] for Mrgs may represent a new class of anti-hyperalgesics for chronic pain, which could suppress central sensitization via peripheral modulation, thereby inhibiting chronic pain without side effects in the central nervous system. Interestingly, the dual effect of BAM8-22 (i.e. inducing itch in the skin and blocking chronic pain in the spinal cord) is analogous to that of morphine (i.e. blocking pain and inducing itch).   The major goal of this project is to carry out a large-scale screen of small molecular compounds for antagonists, agonists, and allosteric modulators of human MrgX1 with therapeutic implications of anti-itch and anti-chronic pain.  Principle of the assay  The principle of the assay is based on that MrgX1 is potently and specifically activated by BAM8-22 (specific peptide agonist) which evokes a large rise in intracellular Ca2+. A three-addition scheme has been established for the multiplex screening of different kinds of modulators in one screen by three additions: 1) 1st addition for drug (library) itself for agonists, as well as an intrinsic counter screen to overcome common non-specificity of the calcium flux assays. 2) 2nd addition: addition of EC10 to EC30 of BAM8-22 for screen of allosteric agonist. 3) 3rd addition: addition of EC90 to ECmax of BAM8-22 for screen of antagonists/allosteric antagonists.  Assay overview:  The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that act as an allosteric agonist for MrgX1. This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses MrgX1 protein. The cells, which loaded with fluorescent dye-Flou4 NW,  are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of calcium flux.. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing MrgX1 were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with Fluo4-NW solution at 37 C for 30min and at RT for 30. min after removing media. 10 uM Compounds were added to the assay buffer with dye and recorded the change of  fluorescence by Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader.  Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated fluorescence ratio. If the compound causes more than 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an agonist of the MrgX1 protein.

Interestingly, the dual effect of BAM8-22 (i.e. inducing itch in the skin and blocking chronic pain in the spinal cord) is analogous to that of morphine (i.e. blocking pain and inducing itch).   Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an ""unpleasant skin sensation that elicits the desire or reflex  to scratch"" [6]. Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) play an essential role in generating itch by detecting itch stimuli through their peripheral axons in the skin and sending signals to the spinal cord via their central axons [7]. The best characterized itch mediator is histamine, which is mainly secreted by skin mast cells and excites nearby sensory fibers by activating histamine receptors [8]. Histamine-induced itch in human skin is almost completely blocked by histamine H1 receptor antagonists. However, the blockers are ineffective in more than two-thirds of itch conditions, such as those arising from atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, renal and liver diseases, drug treatment, poisonous plants and mechanical stimuli [7]. These observations along with other electrophysiological and molecular studies indicate the existence of histamine-independent forms of itch [9-11]. Despite the clinical importance of process, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of histamine-independent itch remain largely undefined. The lack of identified cell surface receptors that directly respond to histamine independent itch stimuli is currently the major hurdle to developing novel anti-pruritus therapeutics.  The major goal of this project is to carry out a large-scale screen of small molecular compounds for antagonists, agonists, and allosteric modulators of human MrgX1 with therapeutic implications of anti-itch and anti-chronic pain.

Description:  The rise in antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the lack of drugs capable of efficiently eradicating persistent bacilli responsible for life-long infections in humans emphasize the need for novel anti-TB agents with mechanisms of action different from those of existing drugs(1, 2). In fact, the latent form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects approximately a third of the global population (3). Class II fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key enzyme of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis induced in M. tuberculosis grown under oxygen-limiting conditions thought to mimic the physical microenvironment encountered by persistent bacilli in pulmonary lesions. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) catalyzes the conversion of fructose bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in a reversible fashion. As a result, this enzyme is a likely target for molecular tools to kill multi-drug-resistant as well as persistent M. tuberculosis (2).  Selective inhibition of FBA is expected to prevent M. tuberculosis from growing on host-derived fatty acids during persistent infection. Although ubiquitous in living organisms, FBAs can be divided into two classes which differ in their structure and reaction mechanism. While class I FBAs are the only type found in mammals, prokaryotes produce class II FBAs. The absence of class II FBAs from mammalian cells and the specificity of their structure and catalytic mechanism should make it possible to design specific inhibitors of class II enzymes that target pathogenic bacteria without affecting the host's gluconeogenetic and glycolytic pathways.

A second helper enzyme, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH), converts the dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate with the concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD, and thus the FBA activity is monitored by the reduction of well fluorescence as measured at 450 nm upon excitation at 340 nm. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 1 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 5 uL /well of Buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10% Glycerol, pH8.0) supplemented with 140 ng/mL FBA, 400 nM ZnCl2, 160 uM NADH and the helper enzymes GDH-TPI (4 U/mL) was dispensed into all wells of a 1536-well plate. Next, 10 nL of test compounds were delivered to each well using a PinTool. DMSO only was dispensed to negative control wells whereas a final concentration of 75 nM of reference compound TD3 was dispensed as a positive control. The assay was then initiated by dispensing 5 uL of Buffer A supplemented with 40 uM of FBP substrate. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes before fluorescence was measured (Ex. 340 nm; Em. 450 nm) using the ViewLux plate reader (Perkin Elmer).  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Compound TD3 (75 nM final)  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all test compounds and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter. Any compound that exhibited a greater % inhibition than this cutoff parameter was declared active.  Potential fluorescent compounds that showed a percent inhibition value significantly higher than the one calculated for the High_Control (i.e. greater than the average % inhibition +/- 3 S.D. of the High_Control wells) were removed from the hit-cutoff calculation.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, and for inactive compounds 1-0.

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 are loaded, intracellularly with the calcium indicator dye, Fluo-8, followed by treatment with agonist control or test compounds. As designed, compounds that act as CHRM1 agonists will increase intracellular calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye and well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-hM1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, and for inactive compounds 1-0.

The experimental values were normalized by the difference between values from neutral and stimulator control wells in each plate. Then normalized data was corrected to remove systematic plate patterns due to artifacts such as dispensing tip issues etc. Further information about data correction is available at http://www.genedata.com/products/screener.html.  To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary and single-concentration confirmation screening data.  a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30. This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator,,,,uHTS identification of cystic fibrosis induced NFkb Inhibitors in a fluoresence assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A764-CF-PAF-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-12-05,,359521,3107,356414,359244,3094,356154,1.1,Live,cell-based format,viability assay,bioluminescence,,,

Jeffrey Conn, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine External Assay ID: CHRM1_ANT_FLUO8_1536_1X%INH PRUN  Name: Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify antagonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1).  Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M1 are loaded with the Fluo-8 calcium indicator dye. Compounds are added followed by treatment with the activator acetylcholine at a concentration that results in 80% activation (Ec80). As designed, compounds that act as CHRM1 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye below that of the Ec80 of acetylcholine. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-hM1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were transferred to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470 - 495 nm excitation and 515 - 575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) prior to all wells being treated with an EC80 concentration of acetylcholine. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay.  Hits for this assay were determined according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read and, I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  The percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Ec80 of acetylcholine and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-7, and for inactive compounds 80-0.  In this assay not all plates were run in the same batch. This resulted in batch-to-batch variation among the different batches of plates, thereby necessitating the use of a plate-based activity cutoff. For this reason the inactive and active scores overlap.

Description:  Lon is an ATP-dependent serine protease responsible for degradation of misfolded proteins, whose name is derived from the phenotype of E. coli mutants lacking Lon activity, which appear longer than their wildtype counterparts (1-3). Lon functions in the degradation of damaged and certain short-lived regulatory proteins (2, 4-12), and Lon activity has been shown to be essential for cellular homeostasis, mediating protein quality control, and metabolic regulation (13-15). Based upon sequence homology, Lon is assigned to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family of proteins, whose members are involved in processes including DNA replication, transcription, membrane fusion, and proteolysis (16-19). Though optimal peptide bond cleavage occurs with hydrolysis of ATP, the ATPase and protease functions are not stoichiometrically linked, as degradation of certain unstructured protein and peptide substrates can occur in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs such as AMP-PNP (20-22).  A primary target of our research is human mitochondrial Lon (hLon). Selective cell permeable modulators will allow the determination of the role that hLon plays in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, which are associated with numerous neuromuscular disorders, cardiomyopathies, cancers and aging. Inhibitors of hLon have potential application as anti-cancer agents, used alone or in combination with other chemotherapies. Bacterial Lon proteases also represent attractive drug targets; inhibitors that selectively block these enzymes, but not hLon, could serve as leads for new antibiotics. The development of new antibiotics to treat resistant pathogens lags far behind the continual rise of pathogenic, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (23). Recently, Lon has been implicated in bacterial virulence (24, 25), offering a new target for potential therapeutic intervention.  The goal of this project is to develop inhibitors that selectively target the human and bacterial Lon proteases. Because bacterial Lon proteases are simpler to express, purify, and characterize, we propose to perform a HTS screen with the E. coli Lon (eLon) enzyme. We anticipate that this screen will yield some inhibitors that show dual activity against human and bacterial Lon proteases, and we will focus our medicinal chemistry efforts on optimizing these leads to generate compounds that selectively inactivate human or bacterial Lon proteases.  In addition to its value as a therapeutic target, Lon is an archetype of architectural simplicity among ATP-dependent proteases. It is currently unclear what distinguishes the various members of the ATP-dependent protease family on a molecular and mechanistic basis. Thus, development of eLon inhibitors would be invaluable for mechanistic elucidation of the ATP-dependent protease family. Selective chemical inhibition of Lon would also allow for further elucidation of the physiological function of Lon in vivo.  References:  1.

Lon is an ATP-dependent serine protease responsible for degradation of misfolded proteins as well as a number of rapidly degraded regulatory proteins. In this assay, eLon protein is incubated with test compounds, the activity-based probe FAM-aldehyde, and non-hydrolyzable cofactor AMP-PNP (an ATP-mimetic cofactor that promotes FAM-aldehyde binding to eLon). The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. The assay is performed by incubating test compounds with eLon for a defined period, followed by addition of the FAM-aldehyde probe and AMP-PNP cofactor and then measurement of fluorescence polarization at a specific time point. As designed, test compounds that act as eLon inhibitors will prevent eLon-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.94 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 5 mM Magnesium acetate and 0.01% Tween20) containing 1.25 uM of eLON protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 40 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.79% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 25 nM FAM-aldehyde probe and 125 uM AMP-PNP cofactor cocktail in assay buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 30 minutes of incubation at 25 C, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic mirror (excitation = 480 nm, emission = 540 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 40 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing eLON protein, FAM-aldehyde/AMP-PNP and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing eLON protein in the presence of test compound and FAM-aldehyde/AMP-PNP. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, FAM-aldehyde/AMP-PNP but, no eLON protein.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of low control wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. % Inhibition values of greater than or equal to 100 are reported as activity score 100.

It has been suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the epithelial lining fluid samples of CF patients(1). Conversely, expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines are reduced(2). 90% of all CF deaths occurs from defective lung function. The activation of NFkB via toll-like receptors following bacterial infection is principally involved in the regulation of lung inflammation in CF(3,4)  This project proposes to develop and optimize a Pseudomonas aeruginosa filtrate (PAF)-induced NFkB-GFP reporter assay using immortalized CF airway epithelial cell line (KKLEB) and screen the MLPCN library for inhibitors of PAF-induced NFkB pathway and distinguish compounds that are inhibiting via the toll-like receptor NFkB pathway to treat lung inflammation in CF.

Then normalized data was corrected to remove systematic plate patterns due to artifacts such as dispensing tip issues etc. Further information about data correction is available at http://www.genedata.com/products/screener.html.  To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented. Its utilization for the assay is described below.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary and single-concentration confirmation screening data.  a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30. This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",,,,,uHTS determination of small molecule cytotoxicity in a fluorescence assay to identify cystic fibrosis induced NFkb Inhibitors,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A769-CF-PAF-Cytotox-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2011-12-12,,359521,1310,358211,359244,1306,357941,1.1,Live,,,,cell-based format,viability assay,fluorescence method

Golden. Ph.D.  Assay Background and Significance:  The goal of this project is to implement a high throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify and develop selective chemical probes that regulate ABCB6 expression or function.  The long-term objective is to use these novel pharmacological tools to understand not only the significance of ABCB6 in tumor growth and proliferation and therapy-related drug resistance, but also ABCB6 substrate specificity and ABCB6 function in normal physiology.  ABCB6 is a member of the B subfamily of half transporters.  Transporters are transmembrane proteins that aid in movement of ions and small molecules through the membrane. Full transporters consist of two transmembrane domains and two ATP-binding cassettes; half transporters have one transmembrane domain and one ATP-binding cassette.  Based on their sequence similarity, transporters are classified into six super-families. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are the largest superfamily, with seven subfamilies that are designated A to G on the basis of sequence and structural homology [1]. ABCB6 regulates cellular porphyrin biosynthesis by transporting coproporphyrinogen III (the final protoporphyrin precursor in the cytoplasm) into mitochondria [2,3]. As predicted from the mRNA sequence homologies both in human bone marrow and CD71+ early erythroid cells, ABCB6 is functionally linked to heme biosynthesis [2]. ABC transporters are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in normal biology and therapeutic responses to medications. The ABCB6 gene has been shown to be amplified in tumor cells with acquired chemotherapeutic resistance [4,5,6], suggesting a role for ABCB6 in drug resistance [7]. ABCB6 expression is induced under cell stress, including hypoxia, where it promotes cell survival [8]. Thus, ABCB6 expression could promote multiple survival strategies that are usually the hallmark of tumor development and progression.  Discovery of compounds that inhibit the function of ABCB6 would aid in understanding the significance of the ABCB6 transport process in tumor cell growth and proliferation and in the development of therapy related drug resistance. In addition, identification of ABCB6 inhibitors will pave the way in understanding the substrate specificity and the function of this transporter in normal physiology and disease pathology.","Primary screening assay is based on measuring the accumulation of porphyrin in the mitochondria by a flow cytometer with excitation at 488nm and emission at 575 nm.  Potential inhibitors of ABCB6 will be identified in the Primary Assay by a decrease in fluorescent signal.    1) Cell cultures of erythroleukemia K562  cell lines stably expressing ABCB6 will be grown at 37 degreesC, 5% CO2 and collected,  resuspended in 5% Serum PBS to a cell density of 4-5 x 10^7 cells/ml. Aliquots of 10 microL volume will be transferred to 384-well plates containing 100 nanoLvolume of the test compounds or DMSO in 5 microL of 5% serum PBS.  2) Test compounds, stored as DMSO stocks, will be diluted in 5% serum PBS.  3) DMSO concentration will be 0.5%, which is well tolerated by the assays.  Positive control are cells exposed to 70 microM benzenthonium chloride. 4) Microplates will be incubated for 1hr at 37 degreesC. 5) HyperCyt(R) sampling will consist of 1-2 microL taken from a 15 microL well volume at room temperature. 6) Data file analyses will use HyperView software programs to automatically detect the time-resolved data clusters (wells), and determine the median channel fluorescence. Data will be automatically exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to calculate the Zprime.  Calculations:  Percent response for this assay is calculated with the following equation: RatioResponse =  100*(Sample/NCntrl) where Sample and NCntrl are the median channel fluorescence for the Sample compound, and negative control well (DMSO).  Compounds are deemed active if their RatioResponse is less than the overall average minus 3 standard deviation for this collection of compounds (i.e., 75%).  Note that if not enough cells were collected for a sample (#events/well > 20), then the compound is described as Undefined outcome.

Description:  Oxidative damage, resulting from the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, is believed to be a major factor in age-related diseases and the aging process. One of the mechanisms by which this damage occurs is via oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide (Met(O)) derivatives in cellular proteins, which can lead to protein inactivation (1). These Met(O) species can be repaired/reduced by the thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent (2, 3) action of Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) (4, 5). MsrA can reduce both free and protein-bound Met(O), and is highly expressed in oxidant-sensitive tissues such as kidney (6), neurons (7), liver(8), retinal epithelial cells (9), and macrophages (10). Each round of methionine oxidation and reduction by the MsrA system destroys one equivalent of ROS (11). Importantly, the action of MsrA has been shown to prevent irreversible oxidative protein damage and extend life span of both flies and yeast (12-14). As a result, the identification of compounds that modulate MsrA activity could have therapeutic value for cardiovascular (15, 16), neurodegenerative, lung (17), and eye diseases (18) involving oxidative damage. Similarly, because MsrA is found in virtually all species (19), and the catalytic mechanism has been elucidated (1, 20, 21), the identification of chemical tools that modulate MsrA would help elucidate its function and activation in cells, and may lead to useful tools to extend lifespan and reduce aging-related diseases (11).

For most MsrA's there are 3 cysteines (Cys) involved in the catalytic reaction. The Cys located nearest the N-terminal is at the catalytic center and attacks the sulfur of the Met(o), followed by release of Met and formation of a sulfenic acid moiety on the enzyme. Subsequent loss of water, followed by a thioldisulfide interchange, leaves the enzyme in an oxidized state. The enzyme must then be reduced in order to function catalytically. Thioredoxin has been shown to be the physiological reducing system for MsrA. This coupled reaction is the basis for this assay.  In this biochemical assay, recombinant MsrA enzyme is incubated in the presence of purified thioredoxin (TrxA) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxB), NADPH, and test compounds. High and low control wells contain 104 uM selenocystamine (SeCm) or DMSO, respectively. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is the hydrogen donor for reduction of oxidized Trx (Trx(o)) by thioredoxin reductase (TrxB). The reduced TrxA reduces dimethyl sulfoxide, the solvent the compounds are contained in, which is catalyzed by MsrA with the formation of a methyl sulfide and regeneration of Trx(o). The reactions are carried out at room temperature in black, 1536-well clear bottom plates and read in at 340 nm. Wells containing SeCm will result in increased oxidation of NADPH to NADP, resulting in decrease well absorbance at 340 nM (ABS340). Activators will be identified as compounds that cause a decrease in ABS340. Compounds are tested at a nominal concentration of 10.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4) containing a cocktail of 1.6 uM MsrA, 4.1 uM TrxA, 358 nM TrxB, and 2 mM NADPH were dispensed into 1536 well microtiter plates.  The assay is then started by transferring test compounds in DMSO, or controls in DMSO (1.04% final concentration). Plates were centrifuged and after 60 minutes of incubation at 25 C, absorbance was read on a EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a 340 nm filter and reading in optimized absorbance mode.  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_activation = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing the MsrA protein cocktail and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing MsrA protein cocktail in the presence of test compound in DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing the MsrA protein cocktail and SeCm in DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of all samples tested and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-8, and for inactive compounds 8-0.

Description:  Nuclear receptors are small molecule- and hormone-regulated transcription factors with discrete DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains, and are essential during development and for maintenance of proper cell function in adults. Small pharmacological compounds that bind to the cleft of the ligand-binding domain could alter receptor conformation and subsequently modify transcription of target genes. Such ligands (agonists and antagonists) have been designed for 23 nuclear receptors among the 48 identified in the human genome (1-3). NR2E3 is an orphan nuclear receptor expressed exclusively in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina (4-7). In its unliganded state, NR2E3 acts as a transcriptional repressor (4, 8, 9) due to interaction with co-repressors such as retinal RetCOR (10), NCOR (11) or SMRT (11). Defects in this gene are a cause of several retinopathies (12-15). Studies showing that mice with a spontaneous deletion in the Nr2e3 gene develop late-onset, progressive retinal degeneration (7), suggest that this nuclear receptor is essential for photoreceptor development and survival. The identification of selective NR2E3 agonists would provide useful tools for the understanding of the biological role of NR2E3 in retinal diseases.  References:  1.

The nuclear receptor interaction domain of NCOR is fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (pGALDBD_NCOR plasmid), while the NR2E3 fragment containing the hinge and ligand-binding domains is fused to VP16 activation domain (pVP16_NR2E3LBD plasmid). CHO-S cells are co-transfected with pGALDBD_NCOR and pVP16_NR2E3LBD plasmids along with the pGL4.31 reporter plasmid containing five GAL4 response elements and expressing luciferase. NR2E3-NCOR interaction inside CHO-S cells results in increased luciferase expression due to recruitment of the VP16 activator to the promoter. Agonistic ligands would induce NCOR release thus reducing luciferase expression. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 4 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-S cell line was routinely cultured in 850 sq cm smooth surface, vented cap roller bottles at 37 C, 95% relative humidity (RH) and shaken at 135-155 rpm. The growth media consisted of Freestyle CHO Expression Medium supplemented with 8 mM L-Glutamine and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  CHO-S cells were suspended in roller bottles at a density of 0.6 million cells/mL in CHO Expression Medium supplemented with 8 mM L-Glutamine. The following day, cells were diluted to a density of 1 million cells/mL and transfected one of two ways: one population was transfected with 0.112 ug/mL of pGL4.31 reporter plasmid, 0.54 ug/mL of pGALDBD_NCOR plasmid and 0.54 ug/mL of pVP16_NR2E3LBD plasmid, complexed with 1.2 uL/mL of Freestyle Max Reagent in 38.4 uL/mL of OptiPRO SFM according to the Freestyle Max Reagent manufacturer's protocol (+NR2E3 cells). The second poplulation was transfected with 0.112 ug/mL of pGL4.31 reporter plasmid and 0.54 ug/mL of pGALDBD_NCOR plasmid, complexed with 1.2 uL/mL of Freestyle Max Reagent in 38.4 uL/mL of OptiPRO SFM according to the Freestyle Max Reagent manufacturer's protocol (-NR2E3 cells). Sixteen hours after transfection, 3750 cells in 5 uL of media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates. The -NR2E3 cell population was dispensed to column 1 and 2 and was used as a high control mimicking inhibition. The +NR2E3 cell population was dispensed over the rest of the plate, with the exception of column 48 that received only media. Next, 20 nL of test compound in DMSO, or DMSO alone were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH.  Luciferase levels were meaasured by adding 5 uL of One-Glo Luciferase Assay (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) to each well; followed by 10 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, Well Luminescence was read on the ViewLux plate reader. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and -NR2E3 cells. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compounds, DMSO and +NR2E3 cells. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO and +NR2E3 cells.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-61, for inactive 61-0.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men and its morbidity has increased globally in recent years. The high mortality rate is closely associated with the spread of malignant cells to various tissues including bone. Nearly 10% of patients whose conditions are diagnosed as PCa initially present with bone metastasis and almost all patients who die of prostate cancers have skeletal involvement. Identifying new mechanisms that control bone metastasis is of great consequence to facilitate the design of therapeutics aimed at decreasing metastatic risk and/or its complications. To address this unmet medical need, our team is actively engaged in exploring the chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and therapeutic significance of modulating tumor cell trafficking and metastasis via chemokine receptor inhibition. The primary objective of this proposal is to use high throughput screening methods to identify small molecule antagonist probes that selectively inhibit CXCR6. Our team intends to address a key hypothesis: The CXCR6/CXCL16 axis significantly contributes to PCa cell metastasis and subsequent bone invasion. A small molecule antagonist would block cancer cell trafficking; hence mediate a metastatic event and disease progression to bone. Thus, access to pharmacologically available small molecule antagonists will ultimately enable our studies in disease relevant models and allow for a more seamless translational advance to clinical applications.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6,,,,uHTS identification of CXCR6 Inhibitors in a B-arrestin luminescence assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A778-CXCR6-Primary-DR-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2012-02-03,,362388,1305,361083,362063,1298,360767,1.2,Live,cell-based format,direct enzyme activity assay,bioluminescence,,,

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify positive allosteric modulators of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1)"" (AID 588819).  This assay uses ATP as the agonist. In this assay, parental CHO-K1 cells are loaded with the Fluo-8 fluorogenic calcium indicator dye for 60 min at 37 C, followed by addition of test compounds, a basal read, addition of ATP (EC20), and measurement of well fluorescence. As designed, a compound that non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will lead to increased fluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were transferred to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of ATP. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing ATP at EC20 and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck counterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

This assay also serves as a counterscreen for a set of previous experiments entitled, ""Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the human M1 muscarinic receptor (CHRM1)"" (AID 588814).  This assay uses ATP as the agonist. In this assay parental CHO-K1 cells are loaded with the Fluo-8 fluorogenic calcium indicator dye for 60 min at 37 C, followed by addition of test compounds. As designed, a compound that non-selectively increases calcium signaling or is an assay artifact will lead to increased fluorescence intensity of the dye, leading to increased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-K1 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay.  A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read. I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Activation = ( (Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing ATP (EC100) and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in this full deck counterscreen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-1, and for inactive compounds 1-0.

Notably, FAS has only marginal importance in adults because dietary fat provides for normal physiology. The link between FAS and cancer was uncovered in 1994 when Frank Kuhajda found that the OA-519 antigen, a marker for poor prognosis in breast and prostate cancer, is actually fatty acid synthase. A number of subsequent immunohistochemical analyses showed that increased expression of FAS is a hallmark of all major cancers. The correlation between expression of FAS and poor prognosis strongly suggests that this enzyme is mechanistically linked to disease progression, providing a strong rationale for pursuing the development of FAS inhibitors.   The FAS protein contains six enzymatic domains and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP).  The final enzymatic pocket is a thioesterase, which liberates the final product (palmitate) from its link to the ACP. It is the thioesterase domain of FAS which we plan to target here.  To our knowledge, no thioesterase (TE) has ever been targeted for drug development.  The goal of this high-throughput assay is to identify hit compounds for the FAS-TE domain. This is accomplished via an enzymatic reaction utilizing a fluorogenic substrate, O-methyl fluorescein heptanoate (OMFH).","A.

The recent derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has allowed for an abundant supply of undifferentiated cells that avoid immune rejection and that could be utilized in patient-tailored therapy. However, prior to establishment of patient specific cells for cell therapy it is important to understand the basic regulation of cell fate decisions in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which includes both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hiPSCs. The use of hPSCs in small-molecule drug screening could help accomplish this goal, in addition to enabling routine toxicity testing and facilitating the evaluation of underlying disease mechanisms. A primary obstacle in the use of hPSCs in research and in high-throughput screening specifically, however, is that they survive poorly upon dissociation and when cultured as single-cells. This limitation also makes the genetic manipulation and the large-scale culture of stem cells a challenging prospect. To address these issues, one of the first 1536-well, ultra-high throughput, luminescent-based assays involving dissociated hiPSCs was developed to identify small-molecules that promote their survival, self-renewal, and/or proliferation when grown in single-cell culture. The assay described herein utilizes a luminescent readout to detect ATP which is directly proportional to the relative number of cells and thus, cell survival in the presence of test compounds, when hiPSCs are plated as single-cells. Thus, the primary goal of this assay is to detect small molecules that can enhance the survival of hiPSCs.","hPSC Assay HTS Protocol:  A.

However, in chronic conditions of overnutrition, such as obesity and lipid storage disorders, excess intracellular lipid accumulation and reduced lipolysis leads to cellular lipotoxicity, which contributes to diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cardiomyopathy (2, 3). The metabolism of cellular lipid is regulated in part by protein-protein interactions near the surface of intracellular lipid droplets. In adipocytes lipolysis is inhibited by the interaction of a protein called abhydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5) with the lipid droplet scaffold protein perilipin A (PLIN). In cells that do not express PLIN, such as myocytes, lipolysis is blocked by similar interactions of ABHD5 with myocyte lipid droplet protein (MLDP) (4). Studies showing reduced lipotoxicity following Plin overexpression (5, 6), combined with population studies identifying ABHD5 mutations as a cause of the lipid storage disease Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (7), suggest that activating lipolysis by blocking interactions of ABHD5 with PLIN or MLDP will increase lipid clearance from adipocytes and other cells, thereby reducing lipotoxicity. As a result, compounds that inhibit these protein interactions may have therapeutic potential for lipid disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (8).  References:  1.

In this G. princeps luciferase complementation assay, ABHD5 fused to the C-terminus of luciferase (ABHD5-LucC) and MLDP fused to the N-terminus of luciferase (MLDP-LucN) are incubated in the presence of test compounds. Binding of the two proteins reconstitutes full length luciferase, leading to an increase in well luminescence. As designed, compounds that inhibit the interaction of ABHD5 and MLDP will prevent luciferase reconstitution, thereby preventing an increase in well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay 2.5 uL of lysate containing recombinant ABHD5 were dispensed into each well of 1536-well microtiter plates. Test compounds or DMSO alone were then added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by adding 2.5 uL of lysate containing recombinant MLDP protein. The plates were incubated for 4 hours at 25 C. Next, the assay was stopped by dispensing 5 uL of Coelenterazine reagent to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing 25 uM Trans-chalcone.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-18, and for inactive compounds 18-0.

This differentiation causes the cells to fuse to form syncytial myotubes characteristic of muscle tissue.  It was previously shown that C2C12 myotubes treated with 10uM simvastatin show a phenotype of decreased ATP levels.  The aim is to identify molecules that are able to suppress the decrease in ATP levels in simvastatin-treated cells.  C2C12 myotubes are seeded in 384-well plates.  After an overnight incubation, growth media was changed to differentiation media containing 2% horse serum.  Following a 4-day incubation, which incudes a media change with fresh differentiation media, cells differentiated to myotubes.  Prior to compound addition, the media is changed again to fresh differentiation media containing 10uM simvastatin.  After a 48-hour incubation, CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) was added and luminescence was detected to measure changes in ATP-levels.  Expected Outcome: Compounds that register an increase in ATP levels compared to positive (geranylgeraniol) and neutral (DMSO) controls, will be considered positives in this assay.","Statin myotoxicy suppressor assay  Cell Line: C2C12 Mouse Myoblasts (ATCC CRL-1772)  Materials: Propagation media: DMEM (Gibco 11995), 10% FBS, 1% PSG Differentiation media: DMEM (Gibco 11995), 1% PSG, 2% Horse serum (Hyclone SH3007403) Differentiation media + 10uM simvastatin: DMEM (Gibco 11995), 1% PSG, 2% Horse serum (Hyclone SH3007403), 10uM Simvastatin (Sigma S6196) Differentiation media + 10uM simvastatin+ 5mM geranylgerinol: DMEM (Gibco 11995), 1% PSG, 2% Horse serum (Hyclone SH3007403),10uM Simvastatin (Sigma S6196), 5mM geranylgeraniol (Sigma G3278) CellTiter-Glo (1:3) with PBS: CellTiter-Glo Custom reagent (Promega), PBS  Procedures: 1.

Compounds that modulate the fidelity of start codon recognition will certainly be useful research tools for probing the molecular mechanics of the start codon recognition in vitro and in vivo and for elucidating gene regulatory processes that rely on utilization on non-optimal initiation codons. In this assay, the ability of small molecules to modulate the fidelity of the start codon recognition will be assessed through the detection of luminescence mediated by the expression of firefly luciferase in yeast under a non-optimal inititation codon UUG. The luminescent signal will be normalized using a internal growth control (redox activity) since the compounds that will affect the utilization of non-optimal inititation codons could also interfere with yeast growth.

The ATPase, Brg1 or Brm, is a central component of the complex.  Mutations in these genes have been linked to human cancer. Recent genome-wide studies from a conditional Brg knockout ES cell line indicate that the esBAF complex can both activate and repress transcription and it frequently regulates promoters at a distance from its binding sites. This mode of regulation is significantly different from the regulation of SWI/SNF complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which exclusively activate genes. A major group of genes directly repressed by esBAF are members of the Polycomb repressive complex, including Bmi1, Cbx7, Ring1, Phc1, Phc2, and Suz12. We selected Bmi1 as a reporter for esBAF activity and have developed a murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) line with a firefly luciferase reporter knocked into the Bmi1 locus. Bmi1 is a particularly interesting target due to its essential role in the maintenance and self-renewal of hematopoietic and neural stem cells.  These modified mESCs were treated with compounds for 24 hours and Bmi-1 expression is measured with the Steady Glo luciferase reagnet (Promega).  The identified inhibitors from the screen will provide the precision and temporal control needed to tease out the precise functions and mechanisms of the BAF complex. These compounds will prove useful to researchers studying stem cells, chromatin remodeling, and cancer. Another important reason for selecting Bmi1 is that compounds regulating the expression of Bmi1 will be interesting independent of their effect on the BAF complex.  Expected Outcome: The esBAF complex represses the transcription of Bmi1 and firefly luciferase is knocked into the Bmi1 locus. Therefore, an inhibitor of the esBAF complex will cause an increase in signal (i.e. increase firefly luciferase activity).","Luciferase Reporter Assay Protocol Materials Corning CellBIND Surface T175 Flasks (Cat# 3292) and Corning HYPERFlasks (Cat# 10024) Corning customized 384-well white CellBIND surface assay plates  ES media: 150 mL ES FBS (Applied Stem Cell, ASM-5007) 10 ml HEPES (GIbco 15630) 10 mL Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco 11360) 10 mL Pen/Strep/Glutamine  (Invitrogen 10378-016) 10 mL Non essential amino acids (Gibco 1140) 1 mL Beta-mercaptoethanol (Gibco 21985-023) 2 mL LIF conditioned media (from Assay Provider) 800 mL DMEM (Gibco 11960) for Propagation media or 800 mL DMEM no Phenol Red (Gibco 31053) for Assay media  Cell line Development A stable mESC line with a luciferase reporter knocked into the Bmi1 locus was developed.

Description:  The goal of this project is to identify modulators (inverse agonists) of the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1, which has been implicated in cancer by enhancing proliferation and cell cycle progression and metabolic disorders through its regulation of genes involved cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis.  NR5A2 or Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) is a member of the NR5A, or Ftz-F1, subfamily V nuclear receptors for which there are four members (1). Murine LRH-1 was originally identified due to its sequence homology to the Drosophila Fushi tarazu factor-1 but orthologs have been subsequently identified in several other species including rat, chicken, horse, zebrafish and human (2-7). LRH-1, and its closest family member steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A1), bind to identical DNA consensus sequences (response elements or REs) and both have the ability to bind phospholipids in their ligand binding domains (LBDs) (8-10). However, LRH-1 and SF-1 are expressed in different tissues and thus are considered likely to have non-overlapping, non-redundant functions. SF-1 expression is confined to steroidogenic tissues and adrenals where it regulates development, differentiation, steroidogenesis and sexual determination (5, 7, 11). LRH-1 is highly expressed in tissues of endodermal origin and its expression is essential for normal liver, intestine, and pancreas function. LRH-1 has also been shown to be expressed in the ovary and adipose tissue.  In a recent report, Chand and colleagues investigated the mechanism of action of LRH-1 in invasive breast cancer cells. They found that LRH-1 promotes motility and cell invasiveness in both ER-positive (MCF-7) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells and similar effects were observed in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Interestingly, both remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cadherin processing were observed when LRH-1 was over-expressed. These findings implicate LRH-1 in promotion of migration and invasion in breast cancer independent of estrogen sensitivity. Together these findings provided strong evidence that LRH-1 plays a significant role in tumor formation both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the identification of potent and selective LRH-1 inverse agonists may provide new approaches for the treatment of cancer.  References:  1. Fayard, E., J. Auwerx, and K.

This assay monitors LRH-1 activity, as measured by inhibition of promoter activity of the Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star). In this assay, HEK293T cells, co-transfected with a full length LRH-1 construct in a pSport6 vector backbone (pS6-LRH-1) and a Star-luciferase reporter construct are incubated for 24 hours with test compound. StAR is a transport protein that regulates cholesterol transfer within the mitochondria, which is the rate-limiting step in the production of steroid hormones. It is primarily present in steroid-producing cells, including theca cells and luteal cells in the ovary, Leydig cells in the testis and cell types in the adrenal cortex. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 3.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Seven million HEK293 cells were seeded in T-175 flasks 23 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v Anti-Anti. Flasks were then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, cells were harvested using TrypLE, resuspended in fresh media at a density of 1 million cells per mL and seeded into new T-175 flasks (23 mL per flask). After being allowed to attach for one hour at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, cells were transfected with 1 mL of preincubated mix of serum-free OptiMEM containing 23 ug of the StAR-Luc reporter plasmid, 11.5 ug of the LRH-1 expression vector and 80 uL of transfection reagents. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 750,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM media supplemented as described above.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of a white, solid-bottom 1536-well plate using a flying reagent dispenser (i.e. 3,750 cells per well). The first two columns received cells transfected with the reporter plasmid only (no cotransfection with the LRH-1 expressing vector) as a control for background luminescence (no LRH-1 cells). Cells were then treated with 18 nL/well of test compounds, DMSO as a negative control (final concentration 0.36%) or SR-1848 as a positive control (36 uM final for full inhibition and 1.2 uM for 50% inhibition) using a PinTool transfer unit (GNF). Plates were then placed in the incubator at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95%RH. Twenty four hours later, plates were removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase was detected by adding 5 uL per well of ONE-Glo luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minutes incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( Median_Positive_Control - Test_Compound ) / ( Median_Positive_Control - Median_Negative_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing cells transfected with the reporter only (no LRH-1 expressed).  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-68, and for inactive compounds 68-0.

More than half of all S. aureus infections in U.S. hospitals are resistant to common antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. Some of the strains of MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), are resistant to ""drugs of last resort"" such as vancomycin. Therefore, new antibacterial agents acting on previously unexploited novel targets must be urgently found.   Comparative and functional genomics studies identified a therapeutically unexplored target pathway, biosynthesis of an indispensable redox cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (2, 6). Targeting of the key essential genes involved in this pathway presents a promising strategy for the development of novel antibiotics(1, 4, 5, 8).   Blocking NAD biosynthesis by inhibition of an essential enzyme, a nicotinic acid mononucleotide  adenylyltransferase (NaMNAT) of the NadD family conserved in most bacterial pathogens, leads to growth suppression of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria(3, 7), thus validating it as a druggable target amenable to inhibition by small molecules.  The primary goal of this high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign is to identify potent inhibitors of S. aureus NadD (saNadD).  Chemical probes inhibiting saNadD function would provide invaluable tools to help elucidate the efficacy of targeting NAD biosynthesis in bacterial pathogens, and would ultimately lead to the development of new antibacterial therapies.  In this biochemical assay, saNadD adenylyltransferase converts nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) in the presence of ATP, into two products, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Formation of PPi product is monitored through malachite green-based colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate (Pi) generated by a coupled pyrophosphatase.   References:  1. Boshoff, H. I., X.

To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",hypothetical protein SA1422,,,,uHTS identification of inhibitors of NadD in a Colorimetric assay,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A804-NadD-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2012-03-15,,362388,2821,359567,362063,2815,359256,1.2,Live,biochemical format,coupled enzyme activity assay,absorbance,,,

Name: Primary cell-based screen for identification of compounds that inhibit the two-pore domain potassium channel KCNK3   Description:  Two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P channels) are essential for the background or ""leak"" potassium conductances that generate the negative membrane potentials in some excitable and non-excitable cells. Their functions go beyond acting as simply leak channels to set resting membrane potentials, and also involve complex regulation of physiological and pathological functions, and are subject to regulation by neurotransmitters, local pH changes, free fatty acids and lysopophospholipids, mechanical forces of the cell membrane, temperature and inhalant aesthetics. TASK1 (KCNK3), as one of the K2P family members, is a pH-dependent, voltage-insensitive, background potassium channel protein, and is in the same TASK channel family as TASK3 (KCNK9). It is widely expressed in multiple organs, with highest mRNA expression in heart, adrenal gland, placenta, adult and fetal lung, pancreatic islet, whole brain and cerebellum. Recent studies on these channels have revealed their molecular identities, voltage independent gating characteristics, and roles as mediators for a variety of important modulators, including volatile anesthetics, neurotransmitters and hormones. Recent data suggest a role for TASK channels in nocturnal activity and they have been hypothesized to contribute to obstructive sleep apneas. Different from TASK3, TASK1 is strongly expressed in the heart where it may contribute to noradrenergic regulation of cardiomyocyte electrophysiology. In addition, specific roles for TASK1 have been described in regulation of breathing by hypoxemia, ischemic neuroprotection and in an experimental autoimmune model of multiple sclerosis.  Consequently, TASK1 has been considered as a possible drug target. However, few TASK specific inhibitors are available as molecular tools for further mechanistic elucidation of TASK1 channel functions, and much less as potential therapeutic leads for the TASK1 related diseases.  Thus, the lack of specific modulators has hindered definitive identification of these channels in native tissues, which is especially critical for mechanistic studies and determining the therapeutic potential for targeting these channels.","The objective of the current screen is to identify compounds that inhibit the flow of ions through KCNK3 using a CHO cell line that stably expresses this channel.   Principle of the assay  Thallium based assays exploit the inherent permeability of potassium channels for another cation[6-7]. In the current work, we have used the FluxORtrade mark (Invitrogen) dye to detect changes in intracellular thallium levels. To assess potassium channel function, cells are initially loaded with FluxORtrade mark dye and incubated with test compounds prior to fluorescence signal recording.  An extracellular solution containing both thallium and potassium is then added, which depolarizes the membrane and consequently causes activation of potassium channels.  The electrochemical gradient drives the net inflow of thallium down its concentration gradient.  The accumulation of intracellular thallium will increase the fluorescence of the FluxORtrade mark dye.  In this way, the thallium signal is used as an indicator for the function of thallium permeable proteins, a method commonly used to reflect the activity of recombinantly expressed cation channels.

Given this gap, our rationale in developing a HTS assay is based on a need for discovering small molecule probes that can specifically act as ""chemical modulators"" of SUMO-mediated signaling and cellular functions. An important objective of this research program is to provide new insight into the regulation of cancer cell resistance to chemo and radiation therapy. A small molecule probe will be utilized to address our key hypothesis: inhibitors of the SUMOdependent protein-protein interactions can sensitize DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation for cancer therapy by inhibiting the Non-Homologous-End-Joining(NHEJ) DNA repair pathway.  Primary assay is a TR-FRET based on the N-terminal-fluorescein tagged-SUMO 1 specific sequence peptide identified from NMR studies by Dr. Chen (F-S1: Fluorescein-linker- DNEIEVIIVWEKK) binding to purified GST-tagged SUMO1 protein, which is then captured by the terbiumlabeled mouse anti-GST-antibody from Cisbio (Tb-anti-GST). The binding event brings the fluorescein acceptor moiety in close proximity to the Tb-donor to allow time-resolved lanthanide fluorescence from the terbium. In an orthogonal assay, the direct fluorescence polarization change of free F-S1 upon binding to the larger SUMO1 is monitored.  REFERENCES Hay, R.T., Protein Modification by SUMO.

NRP-1 is required for induction of vascular permeability by VEGF [5] and semaphorin 3A [6], which interact with the b1 domain of NRP-1 via their C-terminal basic domains.   A recently described class of synthetic ""C-end Rule"" (CendR) peptides share a R/K/XXR/K motif with the C-terminal domains of VEGF-A165 and some semaphorins, and upon binding to NRP-1 induce cell internalization and tissue penetration [7-9]. It was shown that CendR peptides are able to take cargo up to the size of a nanoparticle deep into extravascular tissue [4, 10-12].   The aim of this lead discovery campaign is to find small molecule modulators of the CendR transport pathway. CendR agonists can potentially be useful as tools for introducing compounds into cells and tissues, and in probing the workings of the CendR pathway.  Antagonists could potentially be useful in preventing tissue penetration of inflammatory mediators, toxins, and infectious agents that use the CendR pathway.  This biochemical uHTS assay is based on the ability of a FAM-labeled CendR peptide to bind to the b1b2 domain of the NRP-1 receptor, resulting in an increase in fluorescence polarization.

The human peptidase clan CE is defined by seven proteases with a common fold and catalytic mechanism, commonly known as SENPs [1-3]. SENPs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are specific for processing SUMO precursors and removing SUMO conjugated to protein substrates, while the most divergent member of the family, SENP8, also called NEDP1 [4] or DEN1 [5], is essential for the similar metabolism of the small ubiquitin-related modifier Nedd8 [4, 6]. The major targets for neddylation are cullin proteins that function as part of the catalytic core of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) [7]. The substrates of CRLs crucially regulate cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and DNA damage response mechanisms, and thus the Neddylation machinery constitutes a set of valuable drug targets for cancer therapy [8].  Prior SENP uHTS campaigns using penta-peptide based assays (AID 2575, AID 2582, AID 434986, AID 489001), did not identify selective inhibitors of SENP8, likely due to targeting only the catalytic center. The aim of this lead discovery campaign is to identify novel SENP8 selective probes that target the physiologically relevant substrate-bound conformation of SENP8 induced by Nedd8 protein binding. Potent and selective SENP8 chemical probes would provide invaluable tools to help elucidate the function of this therapeutically important enzyme, and may ultimately lead to the development of new anticancer therapies.  In order to find selective SENP8 ligands and to explore possible allosteric binding sites, we developed a novel Fluorescent Intensity uHTS assay that utilizes physiological protein substrates and is based on SENP8-dependent deconjugation of the aminocoumarin from the Nedd8-AMC substrate.

In terms of normal physiology, this integration is reflected in mitochondrion's high capacity to store Ca2+ which may protect cells like neurons against transient elevation in intracellular Ca2+ during periods of hyperactivity. Furthermore, mitochondrial release of Ca2+ can amplify and sustain signals arising from elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in response to extracellular events. An additional consequence of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is the stimulation of oxidative metabolism through the activation of matrix Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenases. As a result, mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated and is based in a series of specific uptake and release systems. Importantly, regulation of ion fluxes across mitochondrial membranes, specifically the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), is essential since energy is stored in the form of a proton electrochemical potential difference which is used to drive both ATP synthesis and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release.  One mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux pathway is represented by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) which, in vitro, results in an IMM permeability increase to solutes with molecular masses of about 1,500 Da or lower. A great deal of information is available about the functional properties of the mtPTP.  In intact cells under normal conditions, mtPTP opens only transiently (and reversibly). These transient states likely mediate the fast release of Ca2+ from mitochondria in response to normal physiological signals that raise cytosolic, and hence mitochondrial Ca2+ levels to those required for mtPTP activation (the ""threshold""). However, under pathological conditions, persistent activation of the mtPTP has dramatic consequences on cellular and mitochondrial function. This mode of activation results in the collapse of the membrane potential across the IMM (required to drive mitochondrial accumulation of Ca2+ and the synthesis of ATP) and depletion of pyridine nucleotides and respiratory substrates, causing respiratory inhibition and cell death. Consequently, mtPTP has long been implicated as a target for mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo, particularly in the context of specific human pathological events.  The goal of this high-throughput assay is to identify compounds that inhibit mtPTP. This is accomplished via the measurement of the change in absorbance of freshly isolated mitochondria in assay buffer due to swelling which occurs via the uptake of Ca2+ in the presence of test compounds.","1.

BioD catalyzes the irreversible ATP-dependent carbonylation of DAPA to provide dethiobiotin (DTB), and this step drives the BioA reaction forward.  Dethiobiotin is detected by diplacement of a fluorescent dethiobiotin probe (Fl-DTB) from streptavidin resulting in an increase in the fluorescent signal.  The essence of the assay lies in the fluorescence quenching of Fl-DTB by streptavidin and restoration of fluorescence upon release from streptavidin.  Another critical feature of the assay that enables it to be performed in a continuous format is the rapid reversible binding of dethiobiotin and Fl-DTB as a result of the substantially weaker binding affinities of these molecules for streptavidin, which contrasts with the functionally irreversible binding of biotin. Uninhibited BioA enzyme catalyzes the biotin biosynthetic pathway to produce dethiobiotin which displaces coupled Fl-DTB, resulting in increased fluorescent signal. Inhibited BioA enzyme does not produce dethiobiotin and no increase in fluorescent signal is observed. followup assays on hits will eliminate autofluorescent compounds and compounds the inhibit the enzyme BioD, the enzyme the catalyzes the BioA product to dethiobiotin.  Expected Outcome: Inactive compounds show a high fluorescenct signal as dethiobiotin is produced.

Description:  Recent discovery of TMEM16A which encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) has provided a new pathway to identify novel small molecule probes [1-9] for this important and elusive target. Abnormality of CaCC activity is thought to be causal or linked to several major diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and hypertension. Its roles are implicated in numerous physiological processes including cardiac and neuronal excitation, sensory transduction, trans-epithelial secretion, smooth muscle contraction, and fertilization.  Discovery of CaCC-specific chemical probes can provide not only useful tool molecules for pharmacological interrogation of the CaCC function and diversity, but may also provide compounds as starting points for therapeutic efforts to treat various diseases resulting from dysfunction in chloride transport.   Our objective is to find potent and specific small molecule chemical probes that modulate TMEM16A-based calcium-activated chloride channel, by performing a primary screen of the MLSMR library of 300,000 compounds to identify small molecules and structural scaffolds that modulate this calcium-activated chloride channel; and examining and identifying hits with preferential effects on TMEM16A versus other chloride channels after validation, confirmatory and counter-screens. The intended applications of the small molecule probe will be for: (a) the in vitro electrophysiological studies of CaCC functions and modulation, without the limitations of non-specific interactions with related channels; (b) dissection and delineation of the various CaCC currents in multiple tissues; (c) evaluation of potential in vivo applications for rescue of defective chloride transport in cystic fibrosis.  Despite the discovery of the molecular identity of the CaCC channel, it is broadly recognized that there are far less CaCC/TMEM16A specific activators/potentiators available than inhibitors (10-12). Most of reported CaCC activators have been defined are non-specific potentiators, which increase the intracellular Ca2+ and consequentially indirectly affect CaCC. Only until very recently that CaCC (TMEM16A) specific activators without Ca2+ modulation have yet to be reported (13).    Principle of the assay  The iodide ion, which is permeable through the TMEM16A channel, serves as a surrogate for Cl-flux. The iodide flux is detected by YFP Iodide Biosensors (YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L)(14). The activation of the TMEM16A by ionomycin (or ATP) triggers the channel opening and I- influx, and consequentially the quenching of the mutant YFP fluorescence. Any compounds which activate/potentiate the TMEM16A channels will result in increased quenching and lower remaining fluorescence as detected by imaging plate reader FDSS (15).    Assay overview:  The purpose of this assay is to identify test compounds that activate/potentiate the calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A). This assay employs a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses TMEM16A channels. The cells are treated with test compounds, followed by measurement of intracellular iodide, as monitored by a iodide-sensitive fluorescent protein YFP mutant at H148Q/ I152L. Those HEK293 cells stably expressing TMEM16A channels were plated into 384-well plates. On the following day, cells were incubated with assay buffer after removing media. Compounds were added to the assay buffer. Cells were incubated with 10 uM compound for 20 minutes, and fluorescence changes measured upon the addition of trigger solution (16 mM iodide final in the well). The fluorescence of YFP was measured on a Hamamatsu FDSS 6000 kinetic imaging plate reader. Compound effect was evaluated by the calculated YFP fluorescence ratio, normalized with negative controls. If the compound causes less than negative 3 times the standard deviation of the B-scores of the library compounds, the compound is then considered to be active as an activator/potentiator of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channels.

Jeffrey Conn, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine External Assay ID: CHRM5_AG_FLUO8_1536_1X%ACT PRUN  Name: Fluorescence-based cell-based primary high throughput screening assay to identify agonists of the human cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 5 (CHRM5).  Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, which also has sub-micromolar activity toward M5, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. Further, in vivo active tool compounds for the M5 receptor are also unavailable. These tools will prove invaluable for verifying that novel M1 or M4 compounds do not have off target effects on M5 in vivo and assist with determining the role of M5 in the CNS.  References:  1.

In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M5 are loaded intracellularly with the calcium indicator dye, Fluo-8, followed by treatment with agonist control or test compounds. As designed, compounds that act as CHRM5 agonists will increase intracellular calcium mobilization, resulting in increased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye and well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-hM5 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media, lacking Geneticin, were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 80 minutes at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before compound was added.  The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-0, and for inactive compounds 0-0.

The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 50 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 3000 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 80 minutes at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells.The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) followed by a 140 second read after compound addition. Then a basal read of 5 seconds is started prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of acetylcholine. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. This read is the measurement for the PAM mode. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the PAM mode 140 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before EC20 was added.  The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine at EC20 and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO.   PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-28, and for inactive compounds 28-0.

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, which also has sub-micromolar activity toward M5, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. Further, in vivo active tool compounds for the M5 receptor are also unavailable. These tools will prove invaluable for verifying that novel M1 or M4 compounds do not have off target effects on M5 in vivo and assist with determining the role of M5 in the CNS.  References:  1.

In this assay, compounds are added followed by treatment with the activator acetylcholine at a concentration that results in 80% activation (Ec80). As designed, compounds that act as CHRM5 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye below that of the Ec80 of acetylcholine.

Description:  To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems (1-5). Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia (6, 7). In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation (8). Numerous pharmacological studies have provided evidence for a diversity of mAChR subtypes in brain and other tissues (4, 5, 9). These molecularly distinct receptors have important differences, including preferential coupling to various effector systems (see (4, 5) for reviews). In general, it is thought that coupling to Gq and phospholipase C is the predominant effector system coupled to M1, M3, and M5, whereas M2 and M4 most often couple to Gi/Go and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or ion channels.  Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, which also has sub-micromolar activity toward M5, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. In addition, xanomeline has been associated with unwanted gastrointestinal side effects and syncope that resulted in patient non-compliance during the trials (10). Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine hyperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors. Further, in vivo active tool compounds for the M5 receptor are also unavailable. These tools will prove invaluable for verifying that novel M1 or M4 compounds do not have off target effects on M5 in vivo and assist with determining the role of M5 in the CNS.  References:  1.

In this assay, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing human M4 are loaded intracellularly with the calcium indicator dye, Fluo-8, followed by addition of test compounds and subsequent treatment with the activator acetylcholine at a concentration that results in 20% activation (EC20). As designed, compounds that act as CHRM4 PAMs will increase calcium mobilization, increased intracellular calcium and relative fluorescence of the indicator dye beyond that of the EC20 of acetylcholine. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-hM4 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 500 ug/mL Geneticin, 200 ug/mL Hygromycin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 750 cells in 3 uL of growth media were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells.The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices) followed by a 140 second read after compound addition. Then a basal read of 5 seconds is started prior to all wells being treated with an EC20 concentration of acetylcholine. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. This read is the measurement for the PAM mode. A ratio for each well was calculated to normalize assay data, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the PAM mode 140 second read and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before EC20 was added.  The percent activation was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine at EC20 and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing Acetylcholine (EC100) and DMSO.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter determined for each plate (plate based cutoff) was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  In this assay not all plates were run in the same batch. This resulted in batch-to-batch variation among the different batches of plates, thereby necessitating the use of a plate-based activity cutoff. For this reason the inactive and active scores overlap.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-14, and for inactive compounds 42-0.

Hypoglycosylation of alpha-DG impairs its ability to bind to the ECM proteins such as laminins and results in pathogenesis in the muscle and nerve systems and often causes devastating diseases in humans. Currently, there is no specific treatment for any form of MD. Increasing evidence suggests that over-expression of glycosyltransferases enhancing the glycosylation of alpha-DG can restore the functions of alpha-DG in MD mouse models. We hypothesize that cells can enhance glycosylation of alpha-DG in response to certain chemical stimuli. The main goal for this project will be to screen the MLPCN library and identify small molecule compounds that enhance glycosylation of alpha-DG. The assay described herein is a fluorescent, alphascreen-based assay that utilizes an alpha-DG expressing Pro5 cell line to achieve this goal.","A.

Description:  Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is an abundant neurotransmitter synthesized from the essential amino acid L-tryptophan and plays a significant role in appetite, platelet aggregation, pain perception, sleep, hormone secretion, sexual behavior, and thermoregulation. Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function [1, 2]. In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 [3]. Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins [3, 4]. All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins [3, 4]. It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain[4]. These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction [5-7].  References:  1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M. Bowcock, L.A.

The assay monitors GPCR-beta-arrestin proximity using low affinity fragment complementation of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). This assay employs CHO-K1 cells which express Htr2a fused to a beta-gal peptide fragment (enzyme donor), and beta-arrestin fused to the complementary beta-gal fragment (enzyme acceptor). Cells are incubated with test compound, followed by measurement of well luminescence. As designed, compounds that activate Htr2a will cause beta-arrestin recruitment, resulting in reconstitution of the beta-gal holoenzyme. The reconstituted holoenzyme can then catalyze the hydrolysis of a substrate (GalactonStarSubstratetrade mark) which yields a chemiluminescent signal, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7.6 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The CHO-K1 mHTR2A cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated Charcoal/Dextran-treated Fetal Bovine Serum, 800 ug/mL Geneticin, 300 ug/mL Hygromycin B, and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine.  The day before the assay, 3 uL of cell plating media was dispensed into the first column of 1536 well microtiter plates and 1000 cells in 3 uL of cell plating media were seeded into the remaining wells. Plates were centrifuged and then incubated at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 24 hours. Next, 23 nL of test compound in DMSO, Serotonin (30 uM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (0.76% final concentration) were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 2.5 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH. The assay was started by adding 2 uL of PathHunter reagent (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 1 hour of incubation at room temperature, well luminescence was read on a ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland).   The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Activation = ( ( RLU_Test_Compound - Median_RLU_Low_Control ) / ( Median_RLU_High_Control - Median_RLU_Low_Control ) ) * 100  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing cells, Serotonin and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells, test compounds and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for the entire run, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the entire screen's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-7, and for inactive compounds 7-0.

Iniguez-Lluhi, Ph.D., University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI  A growing body of evidence indicates that, SUMOylation plays key homeostatic roles in the androgen mediated development and function of the prostate both by restraining the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR) and by inducing the normal process of senescence, which is a growth-arrest program that limits the lifespan of mammalian cells and prevents tumor progression. Notably, recent data indicates that advanced prostate cancer cells, which are notoriously resistant to current therapies, evade SUMO-mediated homeostatic mechanisms through the specific upregulation of the SUMO protease SENP1. SENP1 is responsible for reversing the SUMOylation of multiple key proteins including AR. Notably, the gene for SENP1 is directly activated by AR and since SENP1 enhances AR activity by reversing AR SUMOylation, this leads to further SENP1 induction, and thus continued and self-sustaining suppression of SUMOylation.  The goal of this project is to identify small molecule inhibitors of the SENP1 enzyme by using a FRET-based assay to screen for selective small molecule inhibitors of the SUMO protease SENP1.

624256,"This bioassay record (AID 624256) belongs to the assay project ""Summary of HTS to identify compounds that promote myeloid differentiation"", which is associated with the summary AID 588701 and a total of 16 additional BioAssay records in PubChem.","UNMCMD Assay Overview: Assay Support:  1 R03 DA032471-01    Project Title:  Discovering small molecules that overcome differentiation arrest in acute myeloid leukemia   PI:  David Sykes, PhD  Screening Center PI:  Larry Sklar, PhD / UNMCMD  Screening Center Manager: Kristine Gouveia Screening Lead: Mark Haynes, PhD Assay Implementation:  Mark Haynes, Stephanie Chavez  Chemistry Center PI:  Stuart Schreiber, PhD / BIPDeC Chemistry Center Manager: Patti Aha Chemistry Lead: Tim Lewis  Assay Background and Significance:  The potential for successful differentiation therapy in acute leukemia was realized with the clinical development of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic. ATRA and arsenic overcome the differentiation arrest imposed by the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa) fusion oncoprotein and treated leukemic promyelocytes terminally differentiate to mature neutrophils. These small molecules are remarkably well-tolerated by patients in comparison to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, incorporating ATRA into treatment regimens single-handedly improved the overall survival of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from 20% to 75% [1]. Unfortunately, differentiation therapy does not exist for the much larger fraction of non-APL acute myeloid leukemias where the standard of care results in an overall survival rate of only 25%.  The mammalian homeobox transcription factors contribute to lineage-specific hematopoietic differentiation, and their expression is tightly regulated during normal hematopoiesis. Though critical to early hematopoiesis, the expression of the HoxA cluster of genes is normally downregulated as cells mature [2]. The persistent, and inappropriate, expression of members of the HoxA cluster of genes has been described in the majority of acute myeloid leukemias. More specifically, HoxA9 has an important role in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. HoxA9 is directly involved in human leukemias as one partner of the fusion protein NUP98- HoxA9 [3]. In analyses of human AML, the level of HoxA9 expression has been correlated with poor prognostic karyotype [4] and inversely correlated with survival [5]. Furthermore, in patients with CML, a relatively higher level of HoxA9 expression was associated with transition from chronic phase to accelerated and blast phase [6]. More recently it has been shown that HoxA9 is critical to the small subset of lymphoid and myeloid leukemias that express fusion oncoproteins involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Leukemias harboring MLL-rearrangements are a particularly poor prognosis subgroup of AML and depend on HoxA9 for proliferation and survival [7]. Overall, this suggests that HoxA9 dysregulation - via fusion with NUP98 or via inappropriate maintenance of HoxA9 expression - is a common pathway in the differentiation arrest in myeloid leukemia. This is an exciting possibility, as it suggests that by specifically targeting this pathway, one might be able to overcome differentiation arrest.  The identification of differentiation therapy has been hindered by the lack of a good model system of differentiation arrest in acute myeloid leukemia. Primary leukemic cells are difficult to isolate and culture, and their availability is limited. Leukemia cell lines (e.g. HL60, NB4, 32D) are readily available though their underlying mechanism of differentiation arrest is not known. Furthermore, these cell lines are only capable of incomplete differentiation and they differentiate in response to non-physiologic stimuli (e.g. DMSO, PMA). Finally, differentiation is cumbersome to assay in a high-throughput fashion, and previous studies have focused on complex screens using qPCR to monitor small changes in gene expression [8]. These problems have made it very difficult to adopt a system for the purpose of high-throughput screening to identify compounds which promote differentiation.  We have devised a novel cell-based assay with advantages over existing systems. The assay (1) provides an unlimited supply of cells, (2) the cells are derived from primary marrow, (3) the differentiation arrest is imposed by a single and clinically relevant oncoprotein, (4) the cells have a built-in marker of differentiation, and (5) when the oncoprotein is inactivated or inhibited, the cells are capable of recapitulating full and normal myeloid differentiation.","This assay will be used to identify small molecules that promote the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. Cells will be arrested in differentiation by the expression of HoxA9 from an estrogen receptor-HoxA9 construct. The screen will be conducted in the presence of estrogen so HoxA9 will be continuously expressed. The cells also contain a GFP construct regulated by the lysozyme promoter. Differentiated cells will express GFP. Small molecules that promote differentiation will be identified by green fluorescence. In order to eliminate compounds that are green fluorescent in nature or compounds that activate the expression of GFP, a MAC1-APC antibody will be used to detect true differentiation. True hits will be identified as those cells that are both green and red fluorescent.  Cells are cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin/L-glutamine, 5% conditioned media containing stem cell factor (SCF; approx. 100nanog/milliL), and beta-estradiol (0.5 microM). The conditioned media is generated by a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line that constitutively expresses and secretes SCF into the supernatant. On day 0, cells are suspended in mediumcontaining Pluronic-F68 (final 0.04%, Sigma P5556) and are dispensed into 384-well plates containing library compounds using an automated dispenser. The plates are incubated for four days under standard conditions (37 degrees-C, humidified, 5% CO2). On day 4, inert polystyrene beads (5 micron; Spherotech CPX) and anti-CD11b (clone M1/70, APC conjugate) are added and the plates are incubated for twenty minutes prior to analysis using high-throughput flow cytometry. Cell viability and green fluorescence is stable for 24 hours after the day 4 time point. Gating on the inert bead population provides a measure of sampling quality. The percent of GFP and APC positive live cells is used to determine whether the test compound has a differentiating effect.  Calculations:  The data are exported into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet template, and the Normalized Percent Positive  is calculated for each well as follows: NORMALIZED PCT POS = 100*(Sample%X+ - DMSO%X+)/(PCntrl%X+ - DMSO%X+) where %X+ is the percentage of the population in the positive region in GFP expression for either wells with Sample, DMSO control or Positive Control (5 microM fulvestrant).  Compounds were deemed active if NORMALIZED PCT POS is equal to or greater than PLATE CUTOFF.  PLATE CUTOFF = Average + 3*Standard Deviation where Average and Standard Deviation are of the Normalized Percent Positive for the Negative Control (DMSO)wells on the plate.  The PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY SCORE equal to the NORMALIZED PCT POS - PLATE CUTOFF.","1. Fenaux, P., et al., Effect of all transretinoic acid in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia.

Description:  The function of members of the cytosolic NOD-like receptor (NLR) family has been the object of much research in the last several years focused on determining their triggers and the signaling pathways that they control. NLRs are involved in initiating pathogenic inflammatory responses to a wide variety of pathogens as well as mediating several important diseases of chronic sterile inflammation (1-2). The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein (NOD) subfamily is characterized by proteins with a caspase-activating and recruitment domain (CARD). NOD1 and NOD2 both sense peptidoglycan, a heterogeneous polymer found in the cell walls of bacteria, but they detect distinct entities within the peptidoglycan polymer: whereas NOD2 detects muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif common to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan (3-4), NOD1 specifically detects diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan, which is found almost exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria (5-6). Through their N-terminal CARD domains, NOD1 and NOD2 couple peptidoglycan recognition to the NFkB pathway through a homophilic interaction with the adaptor kinase RIPK2 (7). This pathway leads to the activation of inflammatory mediators that impact on both host defense and the regulation of the immune response (8).  NOD2 malfunction seems to be involved in Crohn's disease and Blau's syndrome (4, 9-12). Although there are inhibitors of several of the downstream effectors of NOD2 activation, such as IL-1ss, we are not aware of any potent and specific inhibitors, and especially no small molecule inhibitors, of NOD2 activation. Such inhibitors could be very important in novel therapeutic approaches to Crohn's disease and Blau's syndrome. The high throughput assay we have designed and tested has the potential to point to such small molecule inhibitors of NOD2. Further, it has the potential to establish proof-of-concept for the idea of designing small molecule inhibitors of other CARD-CARD interactions important in a large number of other NLR related diseases (12).

This assay uses a CHO cell line that was generated to stably express two beta-lactamase (BLA) fragment fusion proteins: a chimera of RIPK2 fused to BLA fragment ""a"" and a chimera of NOD2 fused to BLA fragment ""b"". These cells have constitutive BLA activity due to the interaction of the RIPK2 and NOD2 components of the chimeras, which brings together BLA fragments ""a"" and ""b"" to reconstitute full length BLA. As designed, test compounds which interrupt RIPK2 and NOD2 interaction will disrupt BLA reconstitution and reduce BLA activity. BLA activity is detected by measuring fluorescence of the cleavable BLA substrate CCF4, which yields either blue fluorescence at 450 nm (FRET) or green fluorescence at 519 nm (no FRET). Test compounds will be screened for inhibition of constitutive RIPK2-NOD2 binding as measured by changes in the ratio of fluorescence emissions at 450 nm and 519 nm. Clavulanic acid, an inhibitor of BLA activity, was implemented as a non specific control. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal test concentration of 4.98 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The stably transfected NOD2 RIPK2 CHO cells were cultured in 500 sq cm triple flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 200 ug/mL geneticin (G418) and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin.  Prior to assay, cells were suspended to a concentration of approximately 200,000 cells/ml in DMEM (Phenol Red Free), containing 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM Hepes, 5 mM L-Glutamine and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin. To start the assay, 5 uL of assay media was dispensed into the first two columns of a 1536 well plate and 5 ul of cell suspension to the remaining wells (1,000 cells per well). Plates were centrifuged and then incubated at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH for 19 hours. Next, 25 nL of test compound in DMSO, Clavulanate (200 uM final concentration) or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH.  Then, 1 uL of the fluorogenic CCF4-AM substrate, prepared according to manufacturer's protocol (LiveBLAzer, Invitrogen), was added to each well. After 2 hours of incubation at 25 C, well fluorescence was measured on the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Turku, Finland) at an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 450 nm. Fluorescence values measured for each channel were corrected by subtracting ""background"" fluorescence, i.e. fluorescence measured in wells containing media only. Background corrected fluorescence emission values were then used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I450 nm/I535 nm  Where:  I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nm.  Percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound Low_Control is defined as wells containing 0.5% DMSO (0% inhibition) High_Control is defined as wells containing 200 uM clavulanate in 0.5% DMSO (100% inhibition).  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-6, and for inactive compounds 6-0.

Description:  Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; also called sleeping sickness) is a neglected tropical disease that is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, which employs the tsetse fly as its insect vector. Related tropical diseases include Chagas disease (caused by Trypanosoma cruzi) and leishmaniasis (caused by Leishmania species). Each of these diseases has a major impact on human health around the world and they lack adequate chemotherapeutic treatment options (1), as current therapies suffer from poor efficacy, oral bioavailability (2), toxicity, and difficult treatment regimens (3). As a result there is a great need to develop novel, more selective, and effective treatments (4). The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) play essential roles in protein synthesis and cell survival and thus are attractive targets for the design of novel chemotherapeutic agents for these diseases (3). aaRS enzymes are essential to translating nucleotide-encoded gene sequences into proteins. Thus, inhibitors that interfere with these enzymes will inhibit formation of properly charged tRNA, leading to accumulation of uncharged tRNA on the ribosome, and disruption of normal protein chain elongation during translation, which are detrimental to cell viability. In particular, genomic studies have revealed sequence differences between the T. brucei trypanosome and mammalian methionyl-tRNA synthetases (MetRSs: which are members of the aaRS family), suggesting that selective inhibition of this enzyme and protozoan death can be achieved using drug-like molecules (2). Using RNA interference, T. brucei MetRS has been shown to be essential for parasite survival (3). In addition, since the MetRS enzymes from Trypanosomatid organisms are highly homologous (particularly in the methionine-ATP binding pocket) it is possible that compounds active against T. brucei MetRS will exhibit activity against the MetRS enzymes from T. cruzi and Leishmania.

In this biochemical ATP depletion assay, methionine, bulk E. coli tRNA, and ATP are incubated with MetRS enzyme in the presence of test compounds. Following the incubation, remaining ATP levels are monitored using well chemiluminescence by addition of the luciferase-luciferin-based Kinase-Glo reagent to each well. As designed, a compound that inhibits MetRS activity will reduce the hydrolysis of ATP that normally occurs as the MetRS enzyme converts L-methionine to L-methionyl-tRNA(Met). Reductions in MetRS activity and ATP hydrolysis increase the relative amount of ATP available for luciferase-mediated cleavage of the luciferin substrate in the Kinase-Glo system, resulting in increased well luminescence. Negative controls include wells that do not contain ATP in the reaction. Positive controls include wells containing 1.5 uM of control compound (SID 136913750), or wells containing no methionine. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 11.9 uM.

Plates were centrifuged. Next, 36 nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.9% final concentration) were distributed into the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at 25 C. The assay was started by the addition of 1.5 ul of a mixture containing Met and tRNA (64 uM Met, 400 ug/ml tRNA) to column 1, 1.5 ul of a mixture containing ATP and tRNA (200 nM ATP, 400 ug/ml tRNA) to column 2 and 1.5 ul of a mixture containing ATP, t-RNA and Methionine (200 nM ATP, 400 ug/ml tRNA, 64 uM Met) to columns 3-48. The plates were then incubated for 2 hour at 25 C. After incubation, 3 ul of Kinase Glo reagent were added to all 48 columns and plates were incubated for another 10 minutes at 25 C.

Helminth targeting drugs, or anthelmintics, have been used to control parasitic nematodes for decades and many species are evolving multidrug resistance. Indiverse organisms, multidrug resistance is mediated by increased expression and activity of enzymes that detoxify xenobiotics. Pharmacological compounds that target xenobiotic detoxification pathways would provide much needed tools for studying multidrug resistance and could greatly increase the useful life of current and future anthelmintics. Few pharmacological compounds are available for studying and targetingmultidrug resistance and those that are available are not specific for nematodes and only target a single enzyme or class of enzymes.  The transcription factor SKN-1 activates the expression of ~100 genes predicted to promote drug modification, conjugation, or export (1-2). SKN-1 is also essential for the development of nematode embryos. Our recent studies have identified a major pathway regulating SKN-1 that is distinct from the major pathway regulating xenobiotic detoxification in mammals. SKN-1 also binds to target DNA by a unique monomeric mechanism relative to all other known basic leucine zipper factors (3,4). Therefore, SKN-1 is a promising target for the development of drugs that disrupt embryonic development, decrease stress resistance, and inhibit xenobiotic detoxification in nematodes without affecting homologous pathways in humans. The small size, simple culturing characteristics, and genetic tractability of C. elegans make it an ideal system to screen for inhibitors of xenobiotic detoxification genes.  REFERENCES 1.

Critical mediators of the hypoxic response are the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are non-redundant and regulate both overlapping and unique downstream target genes. HIF-1alpha has been associated with poor patient survival in multiple tumor types and is currently being pursued as a target for inhibition for cancer therapy 1, 2. HIF-2alpha has also been associated with poor patient prognosis in specific tumor types such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), neuroblastoma, glioblastoma (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 3-6. The tumor type specific function of HIF-2alpha has been linked with the ability of HIF-2alpha (but not HIF-1alpha) to co-operate with a number of oncoproteins such as c-Myc, EGFR and K-Ras 5, 7, 8, and also to activate genes involved in proliferation, invasion and in the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) 9, 10. Hence, although the validity of HIF-1alpha as a target in multiple tumor types cannot be denied, emerging data suggest that in certain settings, the specific inhibition of HIF-2alpha versus HIF-1alpha would be warranted. Additionally, the newly established role of HIF-2alpha in the maintenance of neoplastic but not in normal stem cells, suggests that HIF-2alpha inhibition may provide a novel strategy for the targeting of CSCs 11, 12, 13. Thus our hypothesis is that the specific inhibition of HIF-2alpha will be a useful strategy for treating HIF-2alpha driven tumors and for targeting the CSC population. The overall goal of the study is to identify small molecule specific inhibitors of HIF-2alpha that will lead to the development of new anti-cancer therapies.   REFERENCES 1.

TRAIL selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells whilst normal cells are refractory [1]. TRAIL is safe when administered in vivo and shows none of the toxicity usually associated with other members of the TNF superfamily [2]. TRAIL binds to Death Receptor (DR)-4 or -5 resulting in recruitment of adapter molecules and caspase-8. This recruitment and clustering results in procaspase-8 dimerization, activation, processing and release of active caspase-8 from the complex.  Caspase-8, then, activates the effector caspases resulting in classical apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1; [3]) DR4 and DR5 are widely expressed on cancer cells and it has been suggested that this may be one reason for TRAIL's selective anti-tumor properties [4]. However, a full understanding of the mechanisms of TRAIL selectivity remains elusive.  As TRAIL resistance is the major preclusion to its clinical use, we envisaged a novel high-throughput screen (HTS) to identify sensitizing agents. As non-specificity and toxicity are a major drawback with conventional chemotherapeutics, we propose to discover novel agents acting specifically through the caspase-8 axis as opposed to generalized toxicity. Caspase-8 is an apical protease involved in the ""extrinsic"" or death receptor mediated form of cell death and, as such, would seem to be an ideal candidate for silencing or deletion in cancers. Surprisingly, however, the protein is rarely silenced or absent in cancers, making it an extremely attractive therapeutic intervention point [1, 5, 6]. Caspase-8 has been shown to be involved in various non-apoptotic and potentially pro-tumorigenic processes, such as increased cell motility and metastasis, promotion of growth factor signaling and associations with Rab5 and focal adhesions [1, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Utilization of the caspase-8 null neuroblastoma cell line, NB7, and the same line reconstituted with endogenous levels of wild-type caspase-8 [1] in parallel allows the identification of agents that act specifically via the caspase-8 apoptotic pathway, as the ability to directly compare TRAIL killing ability in cells with the CASP8 gene deleted (NB7) as opposed to those engineered to re-express the protein (NB7+Caspase-8). Thus generally toxic agents can easily be dismissed whilst probes sensitizing to TRAIL induced apoptosis via the caspase-8 axis should be readily apparent. The system is particularly powerful in that it specifically detects agents acting on any molecule or process, known or unknown that relies on the caspase-8 specific apoptotic axis. Additionally, the use of the two cell lines in parallel will allow easy identification of false positives that induce nonspecific cell death.  REFERENCES 1. Finlay D and Vuori K.

Description:  The low molecular weight ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) regulate actin remodeling, vesicle trafficking, membrane lipid composition, and phospholipid metabolism (1). Arfs are members of the Ras family of GTP-binding proteins, switching between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms (2). Arf GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis is regulated by ARFGAPs (ARF GTPase-activating proteins) which associate with the Golgi apparatus and possess a conserved zinc-finger GAP catalytic domain. ARFGAPs such as ARFGAP1 and ASAP1 are found in cell structures involved in vesicle production and trafficking, adhesion, migration, and development (3, 4). ARFGAP1 promotes hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP and is required for dissociation of coat proteins from Golgi-derived membranes and vesicles. ARFGAP1 is stimulated by phosphoinosides and inhibited by phosphatidylcholine (4). Dysfunctional regulation of ARFGAPs has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, alzheimer disease, and autism (3). However, the catalytic mechanism and specific disease-associated roles of ARFGAPs are unclear (2), but recent studies suggest a role for Ca2+ in stimulating ARFGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis (2). As a result the identification of modulators of ARFGAPs would provide useful tools to elucidate ARFGAP biology (4).  References:  1. Donaldson, J.G. and C.L.

ASAP1 has the ability to increase guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis catalyzed by ARFs (ADP-ribosylation factors). The assay measures GDP levels as a function of displacement of a fluorescent GDP analog initially bound to an antibody. Specifically, this assay employs fluorescence polarization to monitor the ability of ASAP1 to enhance the capacity of human ARF1 to hydrolyze GTP (intrinsic GTPase activity) (5). Polarization is a measure of the change in molecular movement of a labeled species and is defined as the ratio of the difference between the vertical and horizontal components of emitted light over their sum. Because polarization is a dimensionless value, it is independent of the emitted light or concentration of fluorophore.  In this assay, purified ASAP1 protein (residues 325-724) is incubated with ARF (lacking its first 17 residues, previously loaded with GTP). After GTP hydrolysis the mixture is then incubated with of a fluorescent version GDP (GDP Alexa 633 Tracer), initially antibody-bound and having high fluorescence polarization (mP). Free GDP derived from ARF-mediated GTP hydrolysis displaces the fluorescent tracer from the antibody, leading to decreased mP. As designed, compounds that act as ASAP1 inhibitors will reduce GTP hydrolysis, thereby preventing displacement of the tracer, resulting in no decrease in mP. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 16.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2 uL of a solution containing 2 uM ASAP1 in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) were dispensed into wells 3-48 and 2 uL assay buffer alone were added to wells 1-3 of a 1536 well-plate. Next, 67.41 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (1.26% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 20 minutes at 25 C.The assay was started by the addition of 2 uL of 4 uM ARF1-GTP to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 120 minutes of incubation at 25 C, 4 uL of detection buffer (1X Stop and Detection Buffer, 4 nM GDP Alexa 633 Tracer, and 3.8 ug/mg GDP antibody in assay buffer, were added to all wells. Plates were centrifiged and after 60 minutes incubation at 25 C, fluorescence polarization was read on an EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a Cy5 FP filter set and a Cy5 dichroic mirror (excitation = 620 nm, emission = 688 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 50 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw2 - Raw1 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the P channel. Raw2 is defined as the S channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing ASAP1, ARF1-GTP and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing ASAP1 and ARF1-GTP in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, ARF1-GTP but, no ASAP1 protein.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test low control wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-10, and for inactive compounds 10-0.

ML4 patients exhibit motor defects, mental retardation, and retinal degeneration.  Currently, there is no treatment for ML4.  By developing a patchclamp method to directly measure the functions of TRPML proteins in the late endosome and lysosome (LEL), we found that TRPML1 mediates Ca2+ and Fe2+ efflux from endosomes and lysosomes, and that PI(3,5)P2, a low-abundance endolysosome-specific phosphoinositide, binds and specifically activates TRPML1.  Under physiological conditions, TRPMLs regulate membrane trafficking by transducing information about PI(3,5)P2 levels into changes in juxtaorganellar Ca2+, thereby triggering membrane fusion/fission events in the late endocytic pathways (endolysosomal trafficking).  In addition, TRPML1 mediates release of Fe2+ from late endosomes and lysosomes, which is essential for cellular iron metabolism.  Thus, impaired ion (Ca2+ and Fe2+) homeostasis underlies lysosomal dysfunction and ML4 phenotypes.  In ML4 cells, the problem is twofold.  First, defective Ca2+-dependent membrane trafficking due to TRPML1-deficiency causes accumulation of lipids and other bio-materials in the lysosome.  The second strike comes from the lysosomal iron overload (due to impairment of TRPML1's Fe2+ conductivity), which converts the accumulated materials into the nondegradable (resistant to lysosomal degradation) lipofuscin (also called aging pigment) in the lysosome.  Lipofuscin accumulation dramatically compromises the functions of lysosomes.  Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is another lysosome storage disease (LSD) with severe neurodegeneration during the childhood.  Currently, there is no cure for NPC.  At the cellular level, NPC cells exhibit similar lysosomal trafficking defects as ML4 cells, as well as cholesterol accumulation.  Our preliminary studies suggest that TRPML1-mediated Ca2+ flux is dramatically compromised in NPC cells, and that increasing TRPML1 channel expression/activity can rescue the trafficking defects and cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells.  Thus, TRPML1 is likely to be an essential regulator of lysosome ion homeostasis.

Description:  Development of a vaccine to prevent AIDS is the best hope for controlling the epidemic that has led to infection of more than 30 million people with the HIV-1 virus worldwide (1). A vaccine approach that reduces viral load would certainly be beneficial, but one that elicits sterilizing immunity would be preferred (2). The HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) is key to vaccine development since it is the only target for neutralizing antibodies (3-5). The Env consists of the gp120 surface glycoprotein and gp41 transmembrane protein associated in a trimer of gp120-gp41 heterodimers. The presence of broadly neutralizing sera from some HIV-1 infected individuals (3, 6-9) and the protection in monkeys by passive transfer of several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (10) suggest that if a suitable antibody response to Env can be obtained, then protection from infection will be possible.   Conventional vaccine approaches based on delivery of HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins or peptides derived from Env sequences have failed to generate broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to the virus, which mutates rapidly to escape from the immune response (11). Recently, new potent and broad neutralizing antibodies against the CD4 binding site (CD4Bs) (VRC01 and VRCPG04) and a novel site on HIV-1 Env trimer consisting of conserved elements on the variable loops V1/2 stem, V2 and V3 on the Env (PG9, PG16) have been defined (12, 13) . These new bNAbs neutralize a broad panel of HIV-1 viruses at concentrations that are an order of magnitude lower than the neutralizing concentrations of ""first generation"" bNAbs (b12, 2G12, 2F5 and 4E10). The availability of these new bNAb reagents enhances the prospect of designing the corresponding immunogens to evaluate as vaccine candidates. Recently published results (14) document that antibody-binding small molecules could be selected by probing a large chemical library with D5, a human mAb that binds to a pre-hairpin fusion intermediate on gp41 of HIV-1. The importance of this finding is that such molecules can be rendered immunogenic by conjugation with a carrier protein thereby forming the basis for development of AIDS vaccine candidates. Since the D5 mAb used in published studies is not very potent and lacks sufficient breadth, we propose to utilize the new more potent bNAbs to test the hypothesis that individual bNAbs can bind specifically to diverse chemical entities that can be selected in a high throughput screen of a large chemical collection. The objective of this proposal is to develop and implement screening assays to utilize existing human mAbs with broad neutralizing activity (bNAbs) to screen a large and diverse small molecule library to identify haptens that bind specifically to the antibody combining site of the bNAb. These small molecule mimetics of the HIV-1 envelope protein could be useful in development of an AIDS vaccine.  This project will exploit the antigen-binding property of newly discovered broad and potent neutralizing antibodies to select complementary small molecule leads that can be used as building blocks for the development of a vaccine to prevent infection with the HIV-1 virus.

Its main function is to bind to CD4 in human cells. One spike is composed of three gp120 and gp41 subunits. Specifically, compounds should inhibit the interaction of Eu-PG9 antibody and BG505 gp120 peptide.  In this assay, test compounds are incubated with a peptide complex comprised of biotinylated-gp120 (BG505 gp120) that has been reacted with XL665-conjugated streptavidin (SA) to form an Env-SA-Allophycocyanin (APC) complex, followed by addition of Europium-conjugated PG9 (Eu-PG9). When PG9 binds to Env gp120, it brings the Eu into close proximity with the APC substrate, resulting in TR-FRET from Eu to XL665. As designed, compounds that prevent or inhibit formation of the PG9-Env complex will reduce the transfer of energy from Eu to XL665, thereby inhibiting well FRET. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 6.7 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2 uL of a mixture containing 0.036 uM gp120 (non-biotinylated) and 0.044 uM SA-XL665 in Assay Buffer (50mM Sodium Phosphate, 0.4 M Potassium Fluoride, 0.1%BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.00), filtered at 0.22 um was dispensed into columns 1 to 3 of 1536-well assay plates. A mixture of 0.036 uM gp120 (biotynilated) and 0.044uM SA-XL665 in Assay Buffer, filtered at 0.22 um, was dispensed into wells 4-48.  Next, 27 nl of compounds or DMSO alone (0.5% final concentration) were distributed into appropiate wells. The plates were incubated for 20 minutes at 25 C. The assay started by the addition of 2 ul of a mixture containing 0.0024 uM PG9 (Europium-conjugated) in Assay Buffer( filtered at 0.22 um), to all wells and plates were centrifuged. The plates were incubated for 1 hr at 25 C, after which TR-FRET was measured by the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). Measurements were performed by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 618 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (XL665) with the ViewLux microplate reader .  To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = ( I671nm / I618nm )  Where:  I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nm.  The percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing gp120 non-biotinylated and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing gp120-biotynilated and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-8, and for inactive compounds 8-0.

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease-associated mutations (1-4). TAAR1 (trace amine associated receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by trace amines. Trace amines (TA) such as Beta-phenethylamine (Beta-PEA), p-tyramine (TYR), octopamine, and tryptamine are endogenous amine compounds that account for less than 1% of the biogenic amines in most brain regions (5), and exert pharmacological actions in humans (6,7). In addition to binding Beta-PEA and TYR, rat TAAR1 is also activated by dopamine, octopamine, tryptamine, amphetamine, and lysergic acid (8-10). TAs are of particular interest because they have been shown to modulate the activity of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (11-13) and gamma-amino butyric acid (14-16) and alterations in their brain levels are associated with schizophrenia (17-19) and depression (20, 21). Their potential to modulate dopaminergic activity suggests that they may play a role in the efficacy of L-DOPA in treating Parkinson disease4 and addiction (13). In humans, only TAAR1 has been shown to be activated by Beta-PEA and TYR, resulting in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation through coupling to Gs (9, 10). Endogenous hTAAR1 activity is predominantly coupled to G-alpha-s and the accumulation of cAMP. The variety of compounds potentially acting at this receptor makes it attractive to assume that hTAAR1 is involved in a variety of integrated CNS processes such as mood and cognition. As a result, hTAAR1 is an interesting target for the development of ligands to probe the role of this receptor in CNS function and disease. For this project, the assay provider has created a cell line expressing the hTAAR1 in a parent cell line (RD-HGA16 cells, Molecular Devices) that stably over expresses the promiscuous G-protein, G-alpha-16, thereby coupling hTAAR1 activation to mobilization of internal calcium stores. Because TAs may be involved in modulating a variety of behaviors including mood, cognition, and addiction, it is of interest to discover novel ligands for TAAR1 to probe the role TAs play in brain function (22, 23).

This assay allows TAAR1 to signal predominantly through calcium mobilization by stably expressing TAAR1 in the RD-HGA16 cell line. The RD-HGA16 cell line is a CHO cell-derived cell line that stably expresses Ga16. Ga16 has been shown to couple many GPCRs to calcium mobilization regardless of their endogenous signaling mechanisms. In other words, this cell line permits the coupling of non-Gq-coupled G-protein-coupled receptors to the mobilization of internal calcium. In this assay a CHO cell line that stably expresses TAAR1 is incubated with a fluorescent, cell permeable calcium indicator dye (Fluo-8) in the presence of the TAAR1 agonist Beta-PEA, followed by the addition of test compounds. The dye serves to monitor levels of intracellular calcium in the CHO-TAAR1 cells. As designed, compounds that act as TAAR1 antagonists will decrease calcium mobilization, resulting in decreased relative fluorescence of the indicator dye, and decreased well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The RD-HGA16 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Ham's F-12 Nutrient Media (F-12) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 400 ug/mL Geneticin, 200 ug/mL Hygromycin and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin and streptomycin).  The day before the assay 750 cells in 3 uL of growth media, lacking Geneticin and Hygromycin, were seeded into each well of 1536 well microtiter plates and allowed to incubate at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH for 17-24 hours. Next, 2 uL of the fluorogenic Fluo-8 intracellular calcium indicator mixture (prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol) was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 75 minutes at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH, followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature. Then, 30nL of 100% DMSO was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Then, 15 nL of test compound in DMSO were dispensed to appropriate wells. The assay was started by performing a basal read of plate fluorescence (470-495 nm excitation and 515-575 nm emission) for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices). Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay. Then, a basal read of plate fluorescence for 5 seconds on the FLIPR Tetra prior to all wells being treated with EC80 of PEA in DMSO. Then a real time fluorescence measurement was immediately performed for the remaining 140 seconds of the assay (this is the read for the antagonist mode).  Hits for this assay were determined according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I_Max / I_Min  Where:  I_Max represents the maximum measured fluorescence emission intensity over the 140 second read for the antagonist mode and; I_Min represents the minimum (basal) measured fluorescence emission intensity before EC80 of PEA was added.  The percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( Ratio Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing PEA (EC80) and DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-44, and for inactive compounds 44-0.

Description:  Heterotrimeric G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major targets for disease therapeutics, due in part to their broad tissue distribution, structural diversity, varied modes of action, and disease-associated mutations (1-4). TAAR1 (trace amine associated receptor 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by trace amines. Trace amines (TA) such as Beta-phenethylamine (Beta-PEA), p-tyramine (TYR), octopamine, and tryptamine are endogenous amine compounds that account for less than 1% of the biogenic amines in most brain regions (5), and exert pharmacological actions in humans (6,7). In addition to binding Beta-PEA and TYR, rat TAAR1 is also activated by dopamine, octopamine, tryptamine, amphetamine, and lysergic acid (8-10). TAs are of particular interest because they have been shown to modulate the activity of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (11-13) and gamma-amino butyric acid (14-16) and alterations in their brain levels are associated with schizophrenia (17-19) and depression (20, 21). Their potential to modulate dopaminergic activity suggests that they may play a role in the efficacy of L-DOPA in treating Parkinson disease4 and addiction (13). In humans, only TAAR1 has been shown to be activated by Beta-PEA and TYR, resulting in increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation through coupling to Gs (9, 10). Endogenous hTAAR1 activity is predominantly coupled to G-alpha-s and the accumulation of cAMP. The variety of compounds potentially acting at this receptor makes it attractive to assume that hTAAR1 is involved in a variety of integrated CNS processes such as mood and cognition. As a result, hTAAR1 is an interesting target for the development of ligands to probe the role of this receptor in CNS function and disease. For this project, the assay provider has created a cell line expressing the hTAAR1 in a parent cell line (RD-HGA16 cells, Molecular Devices) that stably over expresses the promiscuous G-protein, G-alpha-16, thereby coupling hTAAR1 activation to mobilization of internal calcium stores. Because TAs may be involved in modulating a variety of behaviors including mood, cognition, and addiction, it is of interest to discover novel ligands for TAAR1 to probe the role TAs play in brain function (22).

Lindsley Chemistry Lead: Kyle Emmitte Specialized Chemistry Center: Vanderbilt Specialized Chemistry Center For Accelerated Probe Development  Proteases regulate many biological pathways that include: coagulation, immune system activation, metastasis, and viral life cycles. Within the larger set of proteases, pharmaceutical development for the proteases of the two-part bacterial toxins of Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus anthracis is of great interest due to their role in natural disease and biothreat scenarios (1-4).  Botulinum Neurotoxin A Light Chain (BoNTALC) is also an active component of Botulinum Neurotoxin type A (BoNTA), which has become a widely used pharmaceutical (BoTox) that has important uses in the treatment of many diseases. Thus, discovery of BoNTALC inhibitors is also of interest due to the potential of both accidental and intentional misuse of BoTox.  The use of BoNT as a potential biological weapon and the role that BoNTA has in naturally caused botulism has driven much effort in pharmaceutical development targeting BoNTALC. In the USA, serotype A causes >50% of all cases of naturally occurring botulism. While naturally occurring food borne botulism is usually not fatal, symptoms can last for several months. Advances in hygiene and food processing have largely eliminated food borne botulism as a major public health concern but outbreaks still occur in the U.S. No effective pharmaceutical treatment currently exists for any type of botulinum toxin poisoning.  The currently approved treatment for adult BoNTA poisoning is administration of equine antibodies to BoNTA, which cause serious side effects and have a short window of application. In the specialized case of infant botulism, caused by colonization of the large intestine by C. botulinum, a human anti-sera treatment has been approved for use in patients less than 1 year old. Though the available antitoxins provide some effective treatments for natural disease, they are expensive, require refrigeration, and would be difficult to administer in large-scale outbreaks. Therefore, an effective, stable, and inexpensive small molecule inhibitor is very desirable.  The purpose of this screening project is to discover novel small molecule compounds that inhibit BoNTALC  protease. We are seeking to identify compounds that could affect protease activity through alteration of interactions with required domains distal from the cleavage site. Identification of such a novel allosteric inhibitor would truly be state-of-the-art over current active site protease inhibitors. Therefore, we have developed a screening approach that uses full-length substrates attached to microspheres that can detect molecules that either inhibit at the catalytic site or at known required sites distal to the cleavage site.  A potential side effect from this screening method is that compounds with innate fluorescent characterisitics could be registered as active compounds.  Hence, here we report the results of a counterscreen to identify compounds that increase fluorescence (fluorescent compounds).  These compounds have been filtered out as false positives from the primary screen of multiplex HTS with Botulinum Neurotoxin A Light Chain proteases (BoNTALC), Botulinum neurotoxin type F light chain proteases (BoNTFLC), and Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (LF).","The counterscreen assay for potential fluorescent compounds utilized the same protocol as the primary screen to identify small molecule inhibitors of Botulinum toxin type A and F  light chain proteases (BoNTALC and BoNTFLC) and inhibitors of Bacillus anthracis Lethal Factor protease (LF) in a multiplex format.  Protease inhibition assays were performed as previously described (5), but with modifications.  Biotinylated GFP protease substrates for LF,  BoNTALC, BoNTFLC, and a protease-resistant substrate (pinpointGFP) were prepared and loaded on color-coded streptavidin microspheres (Spherotech Blue Array Particle kit, 5.1 mum diameter) as previously described (5-7).  In addition to these four different bead set, there was also a non-GFP labeled bead set added to the multiplex.  This particular bead set was the one utilized to evaluate compound fluorescence.  Additions to wells were in sequence as follows: 1st, 4 microL protease buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Tween-20, pH 7.4); 2nd, 2 microL of a mixture of 1.5 microM LF, 5 nM BoNTALC and 375 nM BoNTFLC in protease buffer; 3rd, 100 nanoL of test compounds (1 mM in DMSO); and 4th, 4 microL containing 2x10^5/ml of each set of microspheres.  Plates were sealed and incubated at 24 degreesC overnight (16-18 h), rotating continuously from inverted to upright position until analyzed in 1536 well plate format with the HyperCyt Cluster Cytometer platform the following day.  In each well the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined for each set of substrate-bearing microspheres as well as for the fifth streptavidin microsphere set with no GFP moiety attached.  Column entitled ""FLUORESCENCE_INTENSITY"" represents the MFI of blank beads that had no GFP.  A compound was scored as ""active"" if it exceeded the mean MFI by 3SD or more. This represented ~11,000 compounds or ~3% of total. Mean MFI was 5176 and SD was 3650. Only wells with >10 beads were included in Mean/SD calculation. Maximum MFI was 114208.   Activity score was calculated as 100 * (Bead MFI - Mean MFI)/(Max MFI - Mean MFI). If bead count was 10 or less the compound was assigned an outcome of 3, activity score of 0 and no MFI values were entered. If bead MFI was <= mean MFI, activity score was set to 0.",Development of the HyperCyt Cluster Cytometer Platform for processing of 1536 well plates by high throughput flow cytometry was supported by NIH/NIMH Grant 1R01HG005066 to Bruce Edwards.,,,,,Counterscreen of compound fluorescence effects on High-throughput multiplex microsphere screening for inhibitors of toxin protease,NMMLSC,UNMCMD_FluorescenceCounterscreen_Protease_HTS,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2012-08-14,,355114,10932,336267,354794,10930,335970,1.1,Live,,,,,,

It has been well established that Akt is activated through two essential steps involving membrane translocation and phosphorylation. Cytosolic Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane via the interaction between the PH domain and membrane PIP3 produced by phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) upon growth factor receptor stimulation. The membrane-Akt interaction results in conformational changes of Akt, enabling its activation through phosphorylation at T308 in the kinase domain and at S473 in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif by PDK1 and mTOR-rictor complex (mTORC2), respectively. Although T308 phosphorylation by PDK1 is indispensible for Akt activation, T308 phosphorylation is significantly boosted by prior phosphorylation of S473. Consistently, S473 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance Akt kinase activity by 4-5 fold. Conversely, knock-down of mTORC2 significantly reduces T308 phosphorylation by PDK1. It has been suggested that the non-phosphorylated C-terminal hydrophobic motif is involved in sustaining the inactive conformer of Akt. These findings indicate that S473 phosphorylation, as an important modulator of Akt activation, may be a valuable drug target for cell growth, survival, proliferation and differentiation.   These inhibitors also may have significant therapeutic potential with fewer side effects, especially for the conditions involving hyperactive Akt signaling, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

Insulin resistance is an important component of the metabolic syndrome. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that regulate insulin signaling are, in principle, excellent therapeutic targets for insulin resistance syndromes. Indeed, PTP1B, a critical negative regulator of insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle, is currently an important drug target in obesity and type 2 diabetes. This grant proposal focuses on another PTP, the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP), encoded by the ACP1 gene. LMPTP is highly expressed in adipocytes. There is strong in vitro and in vivo evidence that LMPTP is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and a promising drug target in obesity. Genetic association studies in humans support a negative role for LMPTP in insulin resistance and the metabolic complications of obesity. In vivo, partial knock-down of LMPTP expression by specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) led to improved glycemic and lipid profiles and decreased insulin resistance in diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, anti-LMPTP ASOs did not induce any metabolic phenotype in lean mice. Our current working model is that LMPTP plays a critical negative role in adipocyte insulin signaling, while it is less important in liver and muscle, where it can be at least partially compensated for by PTP1B and/or other prominent PTPs. We hypothesize that a specific small-molecule inhibitor of LMPTP will significantly reduce obesity associated insulin resistance and decrease the severity of the metabolic syndrome in obesity. Our objective of this endeavor is to screen the NIH chemical library for novel inhibitors of the LMPTP. The focus of the assay will be the identification of non-competitive allosteric inhibitors. This will be accomplished via the use of a fluorogenic substrate of LMPTP.","A.

The experimental values were normalized by the difference between values from neutral and stimulator control wells in each plate. Then normalized data was corrected to remove systematic plate patterns due to artifacts such as dispensing tip issues etc. Further information about data correction is available at http://www.genedata.com/products/screener.html.  To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",Low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase,,,,"uHTS identification of small molecule inhibitors of Low Molecular Weight Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, LMPTP, via a fluorescence intensity assay",Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A890-LMPTP-Inh-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2012-09-04,,364168,818,363350,363840,817,363024,1.1,Live,,,,,,

Description:  The low molecular weight ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) regulate actin remodeling, vesicle trafficking, membrane lipid composition, and phospholipid metabolism (1). Arfs are members of the Ras family of GTP-binding proteins, switching between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms (2). Arf GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis is regulated by ARFGAPs (ARF GTPase-activating proteins) which associate with the Golgi apparatus and possess a conserved zinc-finger GAP catalytic domain. ARFGAPs such as ARFGAP1 and ASAP1 are found in cell structures involved in vesicle production and trafficking, adhesion, migration, and development (3, 4). ARFGAP1 promotes hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP and is required for dissociation of coat proteins from Golgi-derived membranes and vesicles. ARFGAP1 is stimulated by phosphoinosides and inhibited by phosphatidylcholine (4). Dysfunctional regulation of ARFGAPs has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, alzheimer disease, and autism (3). However, the catalytic mechanism and specific disease-associated roles of ARFGAPs are unclear (2), but recent studies suggest a role for Ca2+ in stimulating ARFGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis (2). As a result the identification of modulators of ARFGAPs would provide useful tools to elucidate ARFGAP biology (4,5).  References:  1. Donaldson, J.G. and C.L.

This biochemical assay employs fluorescence polarization to monitor the ability of ARFGAPs to reduce the capacity of ARF1 to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate. Specifically, this assay monitors the capacity of the GAP domain of rat Arfgap1(residues 1-136) to enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of human ARF1 lacking its first 17 residues. Although using the GAP domain instead of the full-length Arfgap1 might potentially miss allosteric inhibitors, the His6-[1-136]Arfgap1 has better solubility than the full-length protein and can be produced in bacteria in large quantities. Polarization is a measure of the change in molecular movement of a labeled species and is defined as the ratio of the difference between the vertical and horizontal components of emitted light over their sum. Because polarization is a dimensionless value, it is independent of the emitted light or concentration of fluorophore.  In this assay, purified Arfgap1 protein (residues 1-136) is incubated with ARF (lacking its first 17 residues, previously loaded with GTP). After GTP hydrolysis the mixture is then incubated with of a fluorescent version GDP (GDP Alexa 633 Tracer), initially antibody-bound and having high fluorescence polarization (mP). Free GDP derived from ARF-mediated GTP hydrolysis displaces the fluorescent tracer from the antibody, leading to decreased mP. As designed, compounds that act as Arfgap1 inhibitors will reduce GTP hydrolysis, thereby preventing displacement of the tracer, resulting in no decrease in mP. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 16.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2 uL of a solution containing 5 uM Arfgap1 in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) were dispensed into wells 3-48 and 2 uL assay buffer alone were added to wells 1-3 of a 1536 well-plate. Next, 67.41 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (1.26% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 20 minutes at 25 C.The assay was started by the addition of 2 uL of 10 uM ARF1-GTP to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 120 minutes of incubation at 25 C, 4 uL of detection buffer (1X Stop and Detection Buffer, 8 nM GDP Alexa 633 Tracer, and 3.8 ug/mg GDP antibody in assay buffer, were added to all wells. Plates were centrifiged and after 60 minutes incubation at 25 C, fluorescence polarization was read on an EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a Cy5 FP filter set and a Cy5 dichroic mirror (excitation = 620 nm, emission = 688 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 50 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw2 - Raw1 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the P channel. Raw2 is defined as the S channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing Arfgap1, ARF1-GTP and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing Arfgap1 and ARF1-GTP in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, ARF1-GTP but, no Arfgap1 protein.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test low control wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-11, and for inactive compounds 11-0.

Description:  The RecBCD enzyme (Exonuclease V) of Escherichia coli is a helicase-nuclease that initiates the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination. The RecBCD class of enzymes is widely distributed among bacteria (1) but is apparently not present in eukaryotes. The major pathway of double-strand DNA break repair in bacteria involves the coordinated action of nuclease and helicase activities provided by the three-subunit enzyme RecBCD, which is critical for DNA repair(2); recBCD null mutants have reduced cell viability, are hyper-sensitive to DNA damaging agents, and are deficient in homologous recombination involving linear DNA (3-5). Inhibitors of RecBCD would allow us to study the mechanism of this complex helicase-nuclease enzyme. Since this enzyme is crucial for bacterial survival during infection, we anticipate that some of these compounds will, in future work, lead to new, critically needed antibacterial drugs with few off-target effects for human use (6).

This bacterial cell-based assay involves infecting E. coli with a T4 bacteriophage that carries three nonsense mutations in gene 2, whose wild-type protein product protects viral DNA from RecBCD-mediated degradation after infection. The mutant T4 phage is able to infect and block the growth of V67 E. coli (recB21, a recBCD null mutation) which lack RecBCD nuclease activity. The mutant phage also infect V66 E. coli (recBCD+), but V66 proliferate because of the RecBCD helicase and nuclease activity against the unprotected mutant phage. In this assay, V66 E. coli are infected with mutant T4 phage in the presence of test compounds, followed by measurement of well optical density as an indicator of bacterial growth. As designed, compounds that inhibit RecBCD will allow the virus to replicate, thereby reducing or blocking V66 bacterial growth, leading to reduced well absorbance. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal test concentration of 11.86 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, V66 and V67 bacterial cultures were grown at 37 C until it reached an OD600 of 0.05 or 2.5E7 cfu/mL. To start the assay, 3 uL of Assay Buffer (0.1% Glycerol + Cation Mueller Hinton Broth) was dispensed into all wells. Next, 60 nL of test compound in DMSO, Ciprofloxacin (0.95 ug/ml final concentration) or DMSO alone (1.2% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells. Then, 1 uL of V66 (recBCD+) or V67 (phage control) bacterial cultures were dispensed into the appropriate wells and plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C.  Next, 1 uL of mutant T4 2 149 bacteriophage was dispensed to the appropriate wells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02. Plates were centrifuged and after 18 hours of incubation at 37 C, absorbance (OD600) was read on a Envision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using 10 flashes per well.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / (Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing V66 + Ciprofloxacin + phage Low_Control is defined as wells containing V66 + DMSO + phage. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing V66 in the presence of test compound + phage.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-10, and for inactive compounds 10-0.

HIV-1 Envs expressed on the surface of cells can mediate the fusion of cells with target cells expressing the CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 receptors, such as CEM lymphoblasts. We have established an assay that monitors the cell-cell fusion activity of HIV-1 Envs with a firefly luciferase readout. In our primary high-throughput screen (HTS), a modified HeLa cell line that inducibly expresses the Envs of a primary HIV-1 strain (HIV-1JRFL) will be co-cultivated with receptor-bearing target cells (CEM21) in the presence of the compounds to be screened.  CEM21 expresses a Tet-activator responsive Luciferase reporter.  This is a Tetracycline regulated system and when the Tet-activator from the Env-expressing cell line is transferred into the target cell upon successful fusion, the Luciferase reporter will be activated.  Detection of Luciferase will occur using the SteadyGlo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI).  Maraviroc, a known CCR5 antagonist, that blocks Env-mediated cell fusion will be used as a positive control.  Expected Outcome: Compounds that inhibit cell fusion will cause a decrease in Luciferase signal.","HIV Fusion Assay Protocol (Streamlined version for HTS)  1.Grow JRFL effector cells in DMEM passage medium with Doxycycline. Split 1:3 or 1:4 for passing.  For HTS: 4 days prior to plating, thaw 3 vials (1.0 x 10;7 cells/ vial) into 4 triple flasks with 120 mL DMEM passage medium/flask. After 3 days, transfer to 3 Hyperflasks (HF) with ~550 mL RPMI induction media (~33 million cells per HF)  2.Day 0: Pass JRFL cells to DoxFree. Wash cells 2x with PBS & add 15 ml Accutase per triple to detach cells. Stop Accutase by adding RPMI induction media.  Spin down cells & seed 9-10 x10;6 cells in 120 ml of RPMI induction medium in triple flask.  3.Day 1: Plating of JRFL cells. Wash cells with PBS & add 15 ml Accutase for triple or 50 ml for HF to detach cells (@ 37 degrees C).  Stop by adding RPMI induction medium. Spin down the cells at 1200 rpm for 5 min & re-suspend in phenol red-free RPMI induction medium (with Puromycin).  4.Count cells, adjust to 1.25 x10;5 cells/mL & seed 2,500 cells per well in 20 microl of RPMI (no Phenol Red) induction medium in Aurora white, opaque 384 well plates.  5.Day 2: Pinning & adding CEM21 cells Spin down & count CEM21 cells.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  decreasing readout signal.  NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3): The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0. The median raw signal of the intraplate positive control wells was set to a normalized activity value of -100. Experimental wells values were scaled to this range. All well activities were then multiplied by -1 to create a positive activity readout value range, to match Pubchem convention.   PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Additive)' in Genedata (v7.0.3) was applied to the normalized plate data.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE: This was set as equal to the mean of the  normalized and corrected  sample replicate activities, rounded to the nearest integer . The minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE required for a compound to be called a hit (the activity threshold, or AT) was set at 50.  PERCENTAGE OF ACTIVE REPLICATES: For each sample, the percentage of replicates (PCT_ACTIVE_REP) which had activity scores >= AT was determined. The minimum percentage of replicates required for a compound to be called a hit (PAR_T) was set at 100.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME: Samples passing BOTH threshold criteria were assigned an outcome of 2 (active): PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE >= AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP >= PAR_T  Samples passing NEITHER threshold criteria were assigned an outcome of 1 (inactive): PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE < AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP < PAR_T  Samples passing AT only were assigned an outcome of 3 (inconclusive) : PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE >= AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP < PAR_T  Samples passing PAR_T only were assigned an outcome of 3 (inconclusive) : PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE < AT, and PCT_ACTIVE_REP >= PAR_T",,,,,HIV entry: Env-mediated Cell Fusion Measured in Cell-Based System Using Plate Reader - 7013-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,Broad Institute,7013-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2012-10-02,,356894,3871,350512,354822,3866,348498,2.1,Live,,,,cell-based format,reporter-gene assay,bioluminescence

Recent gene targeting experiments revealed that EBI2-/- B cells exhibited defective migration, resulting in strongly impaired T cell-dependent antibody responses (1, 2). Most recently, two research teams made the unlikely discovery that oxysterol compounds, previously known to bind nuclear receptors, are the physiologic ligands for EBI2 (3, 4). Although other closely related oxysterols showed some potency and binding capability to EBI2, the most potent endogenous EBI2 receptor ligand and activator was 7alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7alpha,25-OHC) (4). EBI2-/- B cells did not bind 7alpha,25-OHC and mice deficient for cholesterol 25-hydroxylase that is necessary to generate 7alpha,25-OHC display a phenotype similar to that of EBI2-/- mice (3). The recent publication in July 2011 of the deorphanizing of this receptor is a major step forward towards understanding the role of EBI2 in immunobiology. In order to investigate the importance of EBI2 in immune processes and potential as a drug target, selective potent chemical probes that antagonize this receptor need to be identified and made freely available to the research community.  This cell-based luminescent assay utilizes the HitHunter DiscoveRx approach to screen the MLPCN chemical library to identify the first small molecule antagonists of EBI2.  References 1.

MT1-MMP (aka MMP-14) is distinguished from soluble MMPs by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (2). MT1-MMP expression is associated with a variety of pathophysiological conditions and especially so with tumor growth, cancer cell invasion and metastasis (3-6). MT1-MMP accumulates predominantly at the leading and trailing edges in the migrating cells where the proteinase contributes most efficiently to the cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins, adhesion and signaling cell receptors, and the activation of soluble MMPs (3,4). Inhibition of MT1-MMP activity decreases malignant cell migration and invasion in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (7, 8). Because of its importance in cancer and other diseases, MT1-MMP is a promising drug target and its selective inhibitors are urgently needed (9).   REFERENCES 1. Egeblad M, Werb Z.

Ewing sarcoma is a pediatric and young adult cancer that results from a translocation that fuses the DNA binding domain of the Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1) transcription factor to the transactivation domain of the EWS protein, forming the EWS/FLI oncoprotein. This chromosomal translocation produce a mutant transcription factor which directly alters the expression of genes responsible for cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. In this assay, we aim to discover small molecules inhibiting the transcriptional induction of a reporter gene (luciferase) under a specific promoter activated by the EWS/FLi oncoprotein in human A673 rharbosarcoma cells. The small molecules reducing the expression of firefly luciferase under NR0B1 (EWS/Fli-induced) promoter will be measured by the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin and light (luminescence) mediated by the firefly luciferase.

The screening cell line was derived from a single cell clone, and has been fully validated for dependency on EWS/FLI using shRNA knock-down.  Prior to perform the luciferase reporter assay experiments, the cells are maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, 11965) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco, 16140), 1X antibiotic (Penicillin/Streptamycin/Glutamine) (Gibco, Ref. no. 10378-016), 2 microg/ml of puromycin (Invitrogen, A1113802) and 200 microg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen, 10131035) using large flasks (Nunclon Delta surface (triple flasks), Cat. No. 132920) and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37oC (Liconic instruments).  Day 1 (Cell plating):  The A673 NR0B1-Luc/UbC-RL cells are trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin with EDTA (Cellgro, 25-053-CL) and resuspended in phenol red-free DMEM (Invitrogen, 31053-028) 10% Heat inactivated FBS (Gibco, 16140), 1X FBS Penicillin/Streptamycin/Glutamine (Gibco in absence of puromycin and G418. A673 cells are then plated in 384-well format cell culture treated solid white assay plates at a density of 3,000 cells/well using the multidrop dispenser (standard cassette)(Thermo Scientific) in a final volume of 30 ul. The assay plates are placed in 5% CO2 incubator where they are incubated overnight at 37oC.  Day 2 (Compound pinning)  The next day, the assay plates are pulled out of the incubator and are placed side by side on a pinning table adjacent to compound plates containing the MLPCN library and a sentinel plate containing 32 wells containing the positive control cytarabine (Sigma, C1768) at a concentration of 25 uM. 100 nl of the compounds and the positive control cytarabine are then collected on metal pins from these compound plates and transferred to the assay plate. The pins are washed with DMSO and methanol between each transfer. The assay plates are then moved back to the 5% CO2 incubator and incubated for an additional 24h.  Day 3 (Add reagents and read fluorescence/luminescence on Envision)  The assay plates are coming out of the incubator and the fluorescence (Emission 488 nm, Excitation 590 nm) is read using an Envision (Perkin Elmer). Then, 10 ul of a 5% Alamar Blue (Invitrogen, DAL1100) solution in PBS is dispensed in each well of the assay plates using a multidrop dispenser (Thermo Scientific). The cells are incubated for 2h at 37oC. The fluorescence is read again using the Envision. After the reading, 20 ul of Steady-Glo reagent solution (Promega, X1006) diluted 1:1 with water is added in each well. The plates are incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and the luminescence is read on the Envision. Alamar Blue is used as a cell viability marker and is utilized to normalize the luminescence signal associated with the cell number present in the well. The ratio Steady-Glo (luminescence, compound vs. DMSO treated)/Alamar Blue (fluorescence, compound vs. DMSO treated) is then calculated to reflect whether or not the loss of luminescent signal is due to cell toxicity or not. A compound giving a ratio of 1 (100%) will mean that the compound has no effect on the luminescent signal and viability or the compound will inhibit the luminescent signal and decreases the viability with the same factor. A compound with a ratio of 0.5 (50%) will inhibits the luminescent signal by 50% or more and will affect the viability by a factor of half or less compared to the luminescent signal.","PRESENCE OF CONTROLS: Neutral control wells (NC) were included on every plate.

Petroski, Ph.D., Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute  Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are responsible for ~20% of all intracellular protein degradation by the proteasome. This critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis is emphasized by links between CRLs and diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, inflammation, host-pathogen interactions, and the immune response. The activation of CRLs by covalent modification with the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 functions as a major regulatory mechanism to control these enzymes. NEDD8 modifications are essential for cancer cell survival as a small molecule known as MLN4924 that generally inhibits all neddylation pathways selectively induces cancer cell death by triggering S-phase DNA re-replication and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft studies.  UBC12, a member of the 50+ ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein conjugating enzyme (E2) family, is responsible for the direct covalent modification of a subset of cullins with NEDD8 and represents a novel target for small molecule probes. Although E2s have been considered unfavorable targets for probe development due to the absence of obvious catalytic pockets or small molecule binding sites, recent work on the ubiquitin E2 Cdc34 identified a cryptic binding pocket that when occupied by the small molecule CC0651 inhibits the covalent transfer of ubiquitin by preventing a variety of subtle allosteric changes throughout the enzyme. Intriguingly, similar pockets can now be discerned in other E2 structures including UBC12. However, the critical residues necessary for CC0651 binding to Cdc34 are not conserved and it remains unknown if this allosteric activation is a general mechanism used by all E2s or is specific to Cdc34.  The overall objective of this proposal is to identify small molecule probes that inhibit both ATP dependent Nedd8 activation of NAE (E1) and UBC12(E2)-mediated  transfer of NEDD8 from UBC12 onto its cullin substrates. This is done in a TR-FRET assay.  References 1. Watson IR, Irwin MS, Ohh M. NEDD8 pathways in cancer, Sine Quibus Non. Cancer Cell. 2011;19(2):168- 76. 2. Schulman BA, Harper JW.

The experimental values were normalized by the difference between values from neutral and stimulator control wells in each plate. Then normalized data was corrected to remove systematic plate patterns due to artifacts such as dispensing tip issues etc. Further information about data correction is available at http://www.genedata.com/products/screener.html.  To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f.

UNM Cheminformatics: Oleg Ursu, Ph.D.  Chemistry: Vanderbilt Specialized Chemistry Center for Accelerated Probe Development Vanderbilt Specialized Chemistry Center PI: Craig Lindsley, Ph.D. Vanderbilt Chemistry Lead: Michael Wood, Ph.D.  Assay Background and Significance:  Target cell killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), critical for the immune response to viruses and tumors, is involved in transplant rejection and contributes to autoimmune disease pathogenesis. A key mechanism CTLs use to kill target cells is secretion of cell-killing agents from specialized lysosomal lytic granules. Screening a small molecule library for compounds that inhibit lytic granule exocytosis would 1) serve as an assay for blockers of the known signals that control the process; 2) reveal the presence of and define chemical probes for as-yet-unknown signals and 3) lead to novel immunomodulatory drugs that could enhance our ability to transplant organs and stem cells and to treat autoimmune disorders.  CTL granule exocytosis can be monitored using fluorescently-labeled antibodies to detect the externalization of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) from lytic granules to the plasma membrane in a simple no-wash assay protocol suitable for flow cytometry. We plan to capitalize on this simple assay together with the unique HTS flow cytometry capabilities at the University of New Mexico Center for Molecular Discovery (UNMCMD) to establish a phenotypic screen and to discover chemical probes that inhibit granulocyte exocytosis.","The purpose of this assay is to detect compounds that inhibit lytic granule exocytosis in TALL-104 cells.  Lytic granule exocytosis is detected using a fluorescently-labeled antibody to LAMP-1, a lysosomal integral membrane protein that transfers to the plasma membrane as a consequence of exocytosis of lytic granules.  Briefly the protocol for HTS, 4 microL of medium will be added to columns 2-47 of a 1536-well microtitre plate followed by 0.1 microL of test compounds in DMSO (1milliM) added to columns 5-44. Columns 2, 46 and 47 are left empty for analysis purposes. Negative (columns 3 and 4) and positive (column 45) control wells will receive 0.1 microL of DMSO. Cells (5-6 x10^3) are added to columns 3 - 45 in a volume of 4 microL and the plates are mixed and incubated for 30 minutes at 37oC. The resulting mixture's final compound concentration is 10 microM with a DMSO concentration of ~ 1%. Following incubation with test compounds, columns 3 and 4 (unstimulated controls) will receive 2 microL of medium containing alexa647 conjugated anti-LAMP antibody (final dilution 1:500), while wells in columns 5-45 will receive 2 microL of a stimulation solution containing 1 milliM thapsigargin, 50 microM PMA, and alexa647 conjugated anti-LAMP antibody; this addition results in wells that contain 1 microM TG, 50 nanoM PMA and ~1/500 anti-lamp. Plates are incubated with rotation for 120 minutes. Individual wells are sampled using the HyperCyt HTFC platform at a rate of 1 sec/sip resulting in a delivery of >500 cells for analysis (~12 min/plate). Channel fluorescence parameters of individual samples is acquired and saved. Data analysis is accomplished using in-house HyperView software that parses the single data file, generating individual fluorescence values for each well.  Flow cytometeric analysis of the data includes forward and side light scatter that identifies the cell population of interest, alexa647 emission data from stimulated and unstimulated controls wells from each plate are used to create a region gate that delineates stimulated and unstimulated cells such that 95% of the stimulated population falls within the region gate.  Calculations: Averages of % Positive value for the Negative control (NCntrl, stimulated) wells and the Positive control (PCntrl, unstimulated) wells are calculated and their range is used to calculate the % Inhibition of individual sample wells by the following equation: %Inhibition =100 * (NCntrl%Pos - Sample%Pos)/(NCntrl%Pos - PCntrl%Pos) A hit compound has a %Inhibition > 55% Note, lack of sufficient sample size (less than 10 events) results in a well being labeled 'undetermined'.

This is a homogeneous AlphaScreen assay that measures binding of a biotinylated AF4 peptide to FLAG-tagged AF9. The assay configuration comprises a 27-amino acid peptide biotinylated on the N-terminus. The selected peptide encompasses the portion of AF4 shown to be essential for AF9 binding, and an additional N-terminal sequence to provide a spacer between the binding site and the streptavidin-coated AlphaScreen bead.  Binding of biotinylated AF4 peptide to FLAG-tagged AF9 protein is detected by streptavidin-coated donor beads and anti-FLAG-coated acceptor beads. If peptide and protein bind, the beads are brought in proximity; laser excitation of the donor beads results in singlet oxygen (1O2) transfer to the acceptor beads and light emission. If an inhibitor disrupts the peptide-protein interaction by competing with the biotinylated AF4 peptide for binding to AF9, singlet oxygen transfer fails to occur due to the increased distance between donor and acceptor beads.  Expected Outcome: Inhibitor binding is detectable by a decrease in light emission","1.

Description:  Oxidative damage, resulting from the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, is believed to be a major factor in age-related diseases and the aging process. One of the mechanisms by which this damage occurs is via oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide (Met(O)) derivatives in cellular proteins, which can lead to protein inactivation (1). These Met(O) species can be repaired/reduced by the thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent (2, 3) action of Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) (4, 5). MsrA can reduce both free and protein-bound Met(O), and is highly expressed in oxidant-sensitive tissues such as kidney (6), neurons (7), liver(8), retinal epithelial cells (9), and macrophages (10). Each round of methionine oxidation and reduction by the MsrA system destroys one equivalent of ROS (11). Importantly, the action of MsrA has been shown to prevent irreversible oxidative protein damage and extend life span of both flies and yeast (12-14). As a result, the identification of compounds that modulate MsrA activity could have therapeutic value for cardiovascular (15, 16), neurodegenerative, lung (17), and eye diseases (18) involving oxidative damage. Similarly, because MsrA is found in virtually all species (19), and the catalytic mechanism has been elucidated (1, 20, 21), the identification of chemical tools that modulate MsrA would help elucidate its function and activation in cells, and may lead to useful tools to extend lifespan and reduce aging-related diseases (11).

For most MSRA's there are 3 cysteines (Cys) involved in the catalytic reaction. The Cys located nearest the N-terminal is at the catalytic center and attacks the sulfur of the Met(o), followed by release of Met and formation of a sulfenic acid moiety on the enzyme. Subsequent loss of water, followed by a thioldisulfide interchange, leaves the enzyme in an oxidized state. The enzyme must then be reduced in order to function catalytically. The thioredoxin (Trx) system has been shown to be the physiological reducing system for MSRA. However, the enzyme can also be reduced by a variety of chemical reducing agents including dithiothreitol and selenocysteamine (reduced selenocystamine). In addition to Met(o), MSRA is also capable of reducing a variety of methyl sulfoxides including DMSO.  In this biochemical assay, recombinant MSRA enzyme is incubated in the presence of purified thioredoxin reductase (TrxB), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), selenocystamine (SeCm) and test compounds. MSRA reduces the DMSO used as solvent for the test compounds to dimethylsulfide. TrxB catalyzes the transfer of hydrogen from NADPH to SeCm, and the reduced SeCm in turn reduces oxidized MSRA. The reactions are carried out at room temperature in black, 1536-well, clear-bottom plates and are read at 340 nm absorbance. As the reaction proceeds, absorbance at 340 nm will decrease as NADPH is oxidized to NADP. High and low control wells contain either 2 mM N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) in DMSO or DMSO alone. NEM acts as an inhibitor by alkylating the active site of MSRA. Wells containing NEM or a functional inhibitor from the test compounds will show diminished oxidation of NADPH, resulting in stable well absorbance over the course of the assay. Compounds are tested at a nominal concentration of 15.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4) containing a cocktail of 940 nM MSRA, 358 nM TrxB, 100 uM SeCm and 2 mM NADPH were dispensed into 1536 well microtiter plates.  The assay is then started by transferring test compounds in DMSO, or controls in DMSO (1.5% final concentration). Plates were centrifuged and after 40 minutes of incubation at 25 C, absorbance was read on a EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a 340 nm filter and reading in optimized absorbance mode.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as wells containing the MSRA protein cocktail with 100 uM SeCm and DMSO. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing MSRA protein cocktail with 100 uM SeCm in the presence of test compound in DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing the MSRA protein cocktail, 100 uM SeCm and 2 mM NEM in DMSO.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all samples tested and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % Inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-4, and for inactive compounds 4-0.

Description:  Galanin, a 29 amino acid neuropeptide (30 residues in humans), is cleaved from preprogalanin and is involved in many physiological processes including nervous system development, feeding, metabolism and reproduction, and regulation of neurotransmitter and hormone release (1, 2). The physiologic response to galanin is mediated in part by three G protein-coupled metabotropic 7-transmembrane receptor subtypes, GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3. These receptors are expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems as well as the endocrine system. Both GalR1 and GalR2 are widely expressed in the CNS whereas GalR3 is the least abundantly expressed of the galanin receptor subtypes. The GalR3 in particular has been strongly implicated in addiction and mood related disorders such as anxiety and depression. It has been the target of many drug discovery programs within the pharmaceutical industry but despite the significant resources and effort devoted to discovery of galanin receptor subtype selective small molecule modulators, there have been very few reports for the discovery of such molecules and in addition, all access to primary screening data remains proprietary information. As a result the identification of novel GalR3 antagonists would serve as useful tools for understanding galanin biology and for possible investigations into the role of GalR3 in addiction and mood disorders (3-5).

This assay employs HEK293 cells stably transfected with a Gal3/1ctR chimera construct, where ""1ctR"" refers to the carboxy tail of Gal1R, was generated by in-frame fusion of the wildtype GALR3 (residues1-299) and the carboxy terminus of the wildtype Gal1R (299-350). The purpose of the chimera was to eliminate the endoplasmic retention motifs in the carboxy tail of wildtype GALR3 in order to rescue cell surface expression. In this assay HEK293 cells stably expressing Gal3/1ctR chimera construct and a modified cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) acting as a biosensor for cAMP. Changes in cAMP are measured with a combination of membrane potential dye are incubated either with in the presence of test compounds, or with forskolin (EC90) (HIGH control wells) or forskolin (EC90)/galanin peptide (EC90) (LOW control wells). This assay employs the cAMP ACTone biosensor assay. As designed, a compound that inhibits galanin-induced GALR3 activity will decrease Gi-coupled signaling activity will increase galanin inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP levels, leading to an increase in the fluorescence of the membrane potential dye. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The GALR3/1 HEK293-CNG cells were routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated qualified fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-Glutamine, 400 ug/mL Geneticin, 200ug/ml hygromycin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay, 3,000 GALR3/1 HEK293-CNG cells in a 3 uL volume of growth media were dispensed into each well of 1536-well black clear bottom tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The assay was started by dispensing two uL per well of 1X concentrated probe loading dye with 25uM PDEI into all wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours. Following incubation, the compounds are added at 15nL and allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes. Then, the first fluorescence measurement was performed (510-545 nm excitation and 565-625 nm emission) on the FLIPR Tetra (Molecular Devices), then the cells were challenged by pinning 30 nL of forskolin EC90/Galanin EC90 in DMSO. The plates were then incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before the final fluorescence measurement with the same instrument settings.  The following mathematical expression was used to normalize data:  Ratio = T45 / T0  Where:  T0 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity before the addition of stimulus and challenge. T45 represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity 45 minutes post addition of the challenge.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_Low_Control - Median_Ratio_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, forskolin and galanin. Low_Control is defined as wells with DMSO, forskolin and galanin. High_Control is defined as wells with DMSO and forskolin.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-10, and for inactive compounds 10-0.

CtBP was initially recognized as an adenoviral E1A-binding protein and its over-activation, in combination with mutated Ras, leads to tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting CtBP plays a critical role in oncogenesis.  Our studies have shown that CtBP is overexpressed in multiple human cancers, including lung, breast, and head and neck cancers.  In particular, it is over-expressed in 50% of primary lung cancer and 90% of metastatic lesions.  CtBP suppresses epithelial-specific genes as well as genes critical for apoptosis, providing the underlying molecular mechanism for its role in tumorigenesis.  Moreover, we found that CtBP-knockdown in lung cancer cells induced p53-independent apoptosis, and suppressed human tumor growth in mouse model.  Based on the above data, we hypothesize that 1) CtBP suppresses the pro-apoptotic and epithelial genes, therefore overexpressed CtBP in human cancer cells increases EMT and cancer survival; 2) decreasing CtBP's function represents a targeted therapy for lung cancer and potentially multiple cancer types.  As a co-repressor, CtBP binds to E1A and other transcription factors through a conserved peptide motif to carry out its action.  Inhibiting this interaction using small molecules can potentially serve as effective cancer therapeutics.  To this end, we have developed a homogenous AlphaScreen assay targeting the CtBP/E1A interaction.  We performed a large scale HTS of the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) to identify inhibitors of the CtBP/E1A interaction as potential anti-cancer therapeutics.

Its expression is low or undetectable in normal adult breast tissue but the gene is over-expressed in 50% of primary breast tumors and 90% of metastatic lesions.  Our analysis of public microarray databases containing 535 breast cancer samples demonstrates that Six1 levels correlate significantly with shortened time to relapse, shortened time to metastasis, and decreased survival.  Using transgenic and xenograft mouse models, we have demonstrated that mammary specific overexpression of Six1 results in enhanced proliferation, transformation, increased tumor volume, and metastasis.  Importantly, RNA interference against Six1 significantly decreases breast cancer associated metastasis.  Together these data demonstrate that Six1 is necessary and sufficient to induce breast cancer metastasis.  Six1 does not have an intrinsic activation or repression domain and requires the Eya coactivator proteins to activate transcription.  Similar to Six1, Eya2 is also not expressed in most normal adult tissues, but is reexpressed in cancers.  The Six1-Eya interaction is essential for proliferation during embryonic development, and both Six1 and Eya2 have been independently implicated in the same types of cancer.  Because Six1 and Eya2 are embryonic genes with little expression in adult tissues, inhibitors of their expression/activity are likely to have limited side effects.

Description:  Immunosuppressive drugs are critical for organ transplantation and the control of autoimmunity. The current arsenal of usable drugs is limited to small molecules targeting intracellular signaling pathways, e.g. cyclosporine A (1, 2), or antibodies with poorly known mode of action, e.g. OKT3 (3-5). Both categories are endowed with short and long-term life-threatening side effects (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). In most rejection of transplantation situations and in most autoimmune-mediated diseases, T-cell-mediated immunity dominates the adaptive immune response (7-10). Small compounds have focused on T-cell-specific signaling components; however, expression of most of these switches is not exclusive to T cells, explaining many of the adverse effects (3). The targeting of cell surface receptors involved in trafficking, proliferation, and co-stimulation by antibodies does work (11) but does not provide a tunable system easily usable for the long-term. For the same reasons, the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex itself has only been targeted by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in the induction setting of transplantation (3, 4) and in very limited studies of type 1 diabetes (12). Based on this background, we hypothesized that the ideal molecular target for small molecule therapeutics should be the two components of the TCR complex itself, the idiotypic alphaBeta TCR and the associated CD3 signaling dimers. Indeed, the exclusive expression of TCR by T cells will provide absolute specificity whereas the disruption of CD3 engagement will modulate the very first signaling step in T-cell activation.

In order to identify initial compounds that may be capable of achieving this, a TCR mutant containing a cysteine in the loop of the constant domain that is critical for the TCR-CD3 interaction is used. The cysteine allows for fluorophore labeling at that position, and fluorescence recovery from the label is highly dependent on the loop environment. In this assay, recombinant mutant TCR 2C K166C protein labeled with TAMRA is incubated with test compounds and fluorescence polarization is measured. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that potentially act as inhibitors of TCR-CD3 interaction will bind to the TCR-TAMRA probe and induce a conformational change, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.4 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior the start of the assay 1 ul of 0.1 M phosphate Buffer pH 8 containing 0.2 uM TCR previously labeled with TAMRA was added to all wells, 3 ul of 8 M Guanidine Hydrochloride were added to columns 1-3 and 3 ul of 0.1 Phosphate Buffer were added to columns 4-48. Next, 38 nL of test compounds or DMSO alone (0.7% final concentration) were distributed into appropiate wells. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 30 min at 25 C. After incubation fluorescence polarization was read by the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer) using a BODIPY-TMR filter set and BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525 nm, emission = 598 nm).

TRiC is indispensable for cell survival, as folding of an essential subset of cytosolic proteins, including cytoskeletal components, cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressor proteins, exhibits a strict requirement for TRiC which cannot be substituted by other cytosolic chaperones. Despite its central role in cellular folding, little is known about TRiC mechanism and mode of substrate binding. Currently, no specific TRiC inhibitors are available. Given the early promise of other chaperone-directed inhibitors as cancer therapeutics (e.g. HSP90 inhibitors), inhibitors of TRiC activity may also selectively target transformed cells and have potential use as therapeutics for cancer.

Description:  RNA plays a critical role in a host of diseases and can thus serve as an important drug target. The vast majority of RNA targets, however, have not been utilized in targeting endeavors. This is due to a lack of information on the RNA motifs that bind small molecules, such as internal and hairpin loops. Translation of mutant mRNA into protein causes disease. For example, translation of mutant Huntington mRNA, which has expanded r(CAG) repeats, produces a polyQ (glutamine)-containing form of Huntington protein that aggregates in cells and causes toxicity (1, 2). Aggregates form structures that cause cellular dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and cell death, resulting in Huntington's Disease (HD) (3). Both mutant and wild type alleles that produce Huntington mRNA are present in individuals affected with HD. An ideal therapeutic for treating HD, therefore, would inhibit translation of mutant but not wild type Huntington. Small molecules that target the specific structure of expanded r(CAG) repeats (4), not just the sequence, and knock down translation of mutant Huntington could provide more potent and specific HD therapies.   RNAs can also contribute to disease directly without being translated into protein. For example, expanded triplet-repeating transcripts cause a toxic RNA gain-of-function. This mechanism has been most thoroughly documented in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) (5, 6), where expansions of r(CUG) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) transcript fold into an RNA hairpin and bind the pre-mRNA splicing regulator muscleblind-like 1 protein (MBNL1) (6-8), leading to pre-mRNA splicing defects that lead to muscle weakness, insulin insensitivity, and cardiac arrhythmia associated with DM1. Gain-of-function by r(CAG) repeats has also been observed in models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) (5). Another goal of this proposal is to identify r(CAG) repeat binders that displace MBNL1 to correct splicing defects associated with long r(CAG) repeats in HD. These compounds would serve as chemical probes to further define pre-mRNA splicing defects and the pathology of HD and SCA3.  References:  1. Orr, H. T., and Zoghbi, H. Y.

This assay utilizes the fluorescent dye TO-PRO-1 that has increased fluorescence emission upon binding RNA. In this assay, RNA nucleotide containing 1x1 AA internal loops is incubated with TO-PRO-1 and test compounds. After incubation, well fluorescence intensity is measured. As designed, test compounds that bind to the 1x1 AA loops and displace the dye will result in an increase in free (unbound) TO-PRO-1 in the well, leading to lower fluorescence intensity. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 3 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, prepare AA-RNA (rCAG) in assay buffer (8 mM Na2PO4 pH 7.0, 18 5mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5% DMSO) at a final concentration of 1.5 uM.

Description:  The steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family contains three members, SRC-1(1), SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1(2, 3) and SRC-3/AIB-1/pCIP(4, 5), and each plays broad roles in promoting NR-mediated gene expression. Coactivators are required for NRs to function as transcription factors and play key roles as rheostats that determine the amplitude of biological responses to hormones(6). Consistent with the expansive biological roles that NRs play in reproduction, stress responses, energy metabolism and cell growth, disruption of coactivator biological function results in complex and pleiotropic defects. Small molecule inhibitor (SMI) screens for SRC-1 and SRC-3, which play prominent roles in cancer, have already been performed. While it also has a role in cancer, SRC-2 was found to play a critical role in energy intake by driving the dietary absorption of fat(7). SRC-2 achieves this function in response to post translational modification (PTM)-based activation by the primordial energy-sensing kinase, AMPK (among others) which phosphorylates SRC-2, increasing its intrinsic transcriptional activity. We showed that liver-specific ablation of SRC-2 results in a hypoglycemic phenotype in response to fasting(8). We further demonstrated that that hepatic SRC-2 cooperates with RORalpha to specifically drive expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), an essential rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes glucose production during fasting. SMIs capable of targeting SRC-2 could serve as novel therapeutic agents to treat obesity and other metabolic diseases.  References:  1 - Onate, S.A., Tsai, S.Y., Tsai, M.J. & O'Malley, B.W.

In this assay, HEK293 cells are transfected with a GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid (pG5Luc, Promega) and an expression vector encoding SRC2 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (pBIND-SRC-2). The ability of compounds to reduce coactivator transcriptional activity is assessed by measuring luciferase expression from the reporter gene plasmid. As designed, compounds that inhibit SRC2 ability to induce transcription will lead to a decrease in expression of the luciferase gene, resulting in reduced well luminescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 8.9 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Seven million HEK293 cells were seeded in T-175 flasks 23 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v Anti-Anti. Flasks were then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, cells were harvested using TrypLE, resuspended in fresh media at a density of 1 million cells per mL and seeded into new T-175 flasks (23 mL per flask). After being allowed to attach for one hour at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH, cells were transfected with 1 mL of preincubated mix of serum-free OptiMEM containing 23 ug of pG5Luc reporter plasmid, 11.5 ug of pBIND-SRC2 vector and 80 uL of transfection reagents. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 750,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM media supplemented as described above.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of a white, solid-bottom 1536-well plate using a flying reagent dispenser (i.e. 3,750 cells per well). The first two columns received cells transfected with the reporter plasmid and an empty pBIND vector as a control for background luminescence. Cells were then treated with 45 nL/well of test compounds, DMSO as a negative control (final concentration 0.36%) or Gossypol as a positive control (36 uM final) using a PinTool transfer unit (GNF). Plates were then placed in the incubator at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. Twenty four hours later, plates were removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase was detected by adding 5 uL per well of ONE-Glo luciferase detection reagent. After a 15 minutes incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).

Description:  The Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus is a tick-borne negative strand RNA nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection in humans is characterized by high fever, prostration, and severe hemorrhages (1, 2). There is no FDA approved vaccine or therapeutic treatment for CCHFV, which is considered one of the most dangerous emerging human pathogens as well as representing a significant bioterrorist threat agent (1). Investigators have identified an ovarian tumor domain protease (OTU) located in the L-protein of CCHFV and revealed its potential role in suppressing the innate immune response (3). This cysteine protease represents a new viral subclass of OTU domain proteases (vOTUs), which have also been located in economically devastating viruses such as porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and rice stripe virus (RSV) (4, 5). Predominantly, OTUs have been linked to ubiquitin (Ub) removal and/or remodeling of Ub-conjugated proteins, also known as deubiquitination, placing them among five protease superfamilies that facilitate signal transduction cascades and play key roles in protein stability (6). However, unlike all other members of the OTU superfamily, CCHF-vOTU has illustrated not only a preference for Ub-conjugated proteins but also for those proteins conjugated to Ub-like interferon-simulated gene product 15 (ISG15) (7, 8). As conjugation of ISG15 and Ub play crucial roles in the regulation of the human interferon type 1 (IFN1) response plus directly inactivating viral proteins through modification, the presence of a vOTU in CCHFV is currently viewed as a candidate virulence factor for its potential ability to assist CCHFV in evading the innate immune system (3, 9-11). vOTU molecular probes would allow an assessment of whether the molecular probe scaffold can serve as a basis to selectively inhibit other viral and eukaryotic ovarian tumor domain proteases, as well as potentially leading to the development of prophylactics targeting vOTUs and their eukaryotic superfamily relatives that negatively regulate the human innate response.

In this biochemical assay, 40 uL of buffered CCHF-vOTU (1 uM final concentration) and test compound are added first. Then a 10 uL solution containing the peptide substrate Z-ARG-LEU-ARG-GLY-GLY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (pep-AMC, final concentration 50 uM) is added. Pep-AMC shares the last five amino acids with the C-terminus of both ISG15 and Ubiquitin (Ub). CCHF-vOTU like Plpro-CoV and other deubiqutinatases cleave this substrate between the last glycine and AMC, thus allowing AMC to be freed and fluoresce at 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. The assay is allowed to shake at 70 rpm for 30 seconds, and allowed to reach 5 minutes of total reaction time before reading fluorescence at 380 and 460 nm. As designed, test compounds that inhibit CCHF-vOTU protease activity will decrease the cleavage of the pep-AMC substrate, leading to decreasing well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 11.5 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 ul of CCHF-vOTU enzyme (0.5 uM final concentration) in assay Buffer A (5 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) at pH 7.5 was dispensed into wells 4-48 of a 1536 microtiter plate and 4 ul of Buffer A alone into wells 1-3. Next, 30 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.8% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. The assay was started by dispensing 1 ul of Pep-AMC (Z-RLRGG-AMC) substrate (50 uM final concentration) in Buffer B (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1%BSA, 5mM DTT) at pH 7.5 to each well. Plates were centrifuged and fluorescence was read (T0) on aPerkinElmer EnVision using umbelliferone filters: excitation wavelength of 355 nm (with 40 nm bandwidth) and emission wavelength of 460 nm (with 25 nm bandwidth). Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and fluorescence was measured (T30).  The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control )*100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing only Pep AMC and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, CCHF-vOTU and PepAMC.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active. Note: only compounds that were within the assay window were taken into account for the calculations.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-21, and for inactive compounds 21-0.

Ubiquitin is covalently attached to target proteins via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of the acceptor substrate. Additional ubiquitins can be conjugated to any of the 7 lysine residues of ubiquitin or to its N-terminus to form a polyubiquitin chain on the substrate. Assembly of a chain of >=4 ubiquitins linked together via Lys48 of ubiquitin marks cellular proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Ubiquitination of proteins is achieved through an enzymatic cascade involving ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2), and ubiquitin-ligating (E3) enzymes. Ubiquitination occurs when an E3 binds to both substrate and an E2 thioesterified with ubiquitin (E2~Ub), bringing them in proximity so that the ubiquitin is transferred from E2 to substrate.  Among the most intensively studied E3s are members of the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) superfamily, which are regulated by a reversible covalent modification of the cullin with the ubiquitin-like protein, Nedd8. Deconjugation of Nedd8 from cullins is carried out by a novel metalloisopeptidase in the Csn5 subunit of the COP9/Signalosome (CSN). Csn5 appears to be the only enzyme capable of cleaving Nedd8 from Cul1 in vivo.  CSN is an excellent candidate for the development of a small molecule inhibitor because such a compound would greatly facilitate cell biological studies of this key regulatory factor.","Protocol: A.

The experimental values were normalized by the difference between values from neutral and stimulator control wells in each plate. Then normalized data was corrected to remove systematic plate patterns due to artifacts such as dispensing tip issues etc. Further information about data correction is available at http://www.genedata.com/products/screener.html.  To simplify the distinction between the inactives of the primary screen and of the confirmatory screening stage, the Tiered Activity Scoring System was developed and implemented.   Activity Scoring Activity scoring rules were devised to take into consideration compound efficacy, its potential interference with the assay and the screening stage that the data was obtained. Details of the Scoring System will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the outline of the scoring system utilized for the assay is as follows:  1) First tier (0-40 range) is reserved for primary screening data. The score is correlated with % activity in the assay: a. If outcome of the primary screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 0 b. If outcome of the primary screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 10 c. If outcome of the primary screen is active, then the assigned score is 20 Scoring for Single concentration confirmation screening is not applicable to this assay. d. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inactive, then the assigned score is 21 e. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is inconclusive, then the assigned score is 25 f. If outcome of the single-concentration confirmation screen is active, then the assigned score is 30 This scoring system helps track the stage of the testing of a particular SID. For the primary hits which are available for confirmation, their scores will be greater than 20. For those which are not further confirmed, their score will stay under 21.  2) Second tier (41-80 range) is reserved for dose-response confirmation data and is not applicable in this assay  3) Third tier (81-100 range) is reserved for resynthesized true positives and their analogues and is not applicable in this assay",COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5,,,,"uHTS identification of small molecule inhibitors of Csn-mediated Deneddylation of Cullin-Ring Ligases, vis a fluorescence polarization assay",Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A954-CSN5-Inh-Primary-Assay,NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network,Primary Screening,2013-01-30,,364168,1402,362766,363840,1401,362442,1.1,Live,,,,,,

Description:  Nuclear receptors are a family of small molecule and hormone-regulated transcription factors that share conserved DNA-binding (DBD) and ligand-binding domains (LBD) (1-3). Of interest, DAX-1 (NR0B1; nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1; dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome gene 1) is an orphan nuclear receptor shown to act as a robust transcriptional repressor, inhibiting genes involved in steroidogenesis through interaction with corepressors and regulating the pluripotency of stem cells (4-8). The human DAX-1 gene encodes a protein whose C terminus is similar to the LBD of nuclear hormone receptors, while its N terminus is composed of three cysteine-rich 70 amino acids with little similarity to known proteins (4, 7). Mutations in DAX-1 have been shown to cause the X-linked form of adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC), associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG). AHC-HHG-associated mutations share an altered DAX-1 C-terminal domain (5, 9), resulting in loss of transcriptional repression activity (5, 7, 9), which suggests that impairment of the DAX-1 transcriptional activity is directly linked to AHC-HHG pathogenesis. In addition, DAX-1 is highly expressed in pediatric Ewing tumors (10). As a result, the identification of selective inhibitors of DAX-1 will serve as useful tools to elucidate its roles of in steroidogenesis, tumorigenesis, and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency (8).

DAX-1 has been shown to inhibit SF-1-mediated transactivation (5).  SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1; NR5A1) has been shown to function as a transcription factor for a variety of different steroidogenic enzyme genes in the adrenal gland and gonads. Specifically, SF-1 has been shown to induce differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into steroidogenic cells with concomitant strong induction of StAR expression.  This assay employs HEK293T cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing SF-1 and a luciferase reporter under control of the StAR promoter together with an expression plasmids for DAX-1, followed by treatment with test compounds. Under normal conditions, DAX-1 represses the SF-1-induced expression of the luciferase reporter. As designed, a compound that inhibits DAX-1 activity will reduce DAX1-mediated repression of SF-1, thereby allowing SF-1 to increase StAR promoter activity, resulting in increased well luminescence. Compounds will be tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 6.8 uM.  Protocol Summary:  HEK293 cells were routinely cultured in T-175 flasks containing 25 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic mix at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, the HEK293 cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE reagents and seeded in fresh media at a density of 10 million cells per T175 flask. The following day, cells were transfected with 5 mL of serum-free OptiMEM containing 28 ug of the StAR promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, 14 ug of the SF-1 expressing palsmid, 21 ug of the DAX-1 expressing plasmid and 100 uL of transfection reagent. Four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of preheated TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM supplemented as above. In the absence of a pharmacological positive control, DAX-1 inhibition was mimicked by transfecting cells with an empty vector in place of the DAX-1 expressing vector.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, solid-bottom 1536-well plates using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora). The first three columns received control cells (no DAX-1 expressed) whereas the rest of the plate was dispensed with DAX1-transfected cells. The plates were then treated with 34 nL/well of test compounds or DMSO (final concentration 0.68%) on DAX-1 cells and Control cells using a PinTool transfer unit (GNF). Plates were incubated for eighteen hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95%RH. Plates were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by addition of 5 uL of SteadyLite reagent to each well. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent inhibition of each test compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( 1 - ( median_positive_control - test_compound ) / (median_positive_control - median_negative_control ) * 100  Where:  Positive control is defined as wells containing control cells (no DAX-1 expressed) treated with DMSO. Negative control is defined as wells containing DAX-1 cells treated with DMSO. Test compound is defined as wells containing DAX-1 cells containing test compound.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-4, and for inactive compounds 4-0.

Description:  The protein encoded by the BRM gene (SMARCA2, SNF2, SWI2) is a member of the SWI/SNF family of proteins and is highly similar to the brahma protein of Drosophila (1). Members of this family have helicase and ATPase activities and are thought to regulate transcription of certain genes by altering the chromatin structure around those genes (2). The encoded protein is part of the large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SNF/SWI, which is required for transcriptional activation of genes normally repressed by chromatin. BRM is an epigenetically suppressed anti-cancer gene, which is silenced in wide variety of solid tumors (2). Because BRM function is key for growth control, restoring its expression routinely inhibits cancer cell growth. For this reason, restoring BRM has potential as an anticancer therapeutic modality (3-4). Its expression prevents cancer development as seen in murine models system where BRM loss potentiates cancer development 10-fold (5). It is known from preliminary studies that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are found to restore BRM expression in cancer cell lines, but not its function (2). However, BRM is involved in many pathways and required by numerous transcription factors which control development, differentiation, DNA repair, adhesion, and growth control (6). As such, the impact of inactivating BRM and/or restoring its expression goes well beyond growth control (7).  Although pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are found to restore BRM expression, but not its function in cancer cell lines, specific inhibitors of either HDAC3 or HDAC9, as well as the transcription factor GATA3 and/or MEF2D, induce a functional BRM. These other constituents involved in BRM regulation may also be the molecular targets. However, since HDAC9 and GATA3 are highly overexpressed and given the limited scope of expression of HDAC9, these proteins would be preferred targets. The fact that each are highly over-expressed is akin to EGFR in lung cancer or HER2 in breast cancer. Candidate compounds that are positive on the primary screen will be re-screened using our counter-screen, where BRM has been suppressed using anti-BRM shRNA (MG2-KDM). We have found that even the most potent inducers of BRM, are blocked by at least 50% or more by this assay. Hence, false positives will yield readouts of luciferase activity that show >50% inductions, closely approximating the levels found in the primary BRM (MG213) screen and will not have inductions <50% as observed with essentially all BRM-specific inducers.  Compounds will be then be verified as positive hits by a series of assays beginning with a third confirmatory (dose response) screening. Following the dose response screening, hits will be screened by directly measuring BRM induction by qPCR since the BRM gene is controlled by transcription. Additionally, we will determine the relative specificity the hits identified by screening each for its potential to induce a number (~10) of BRM-dependent genes. Since each of these BRM-dependent genes are controlled by different signal transduction pathways, interference in one or more cellular pathways (due to lack of specificity for BRM) will be demonstrated by a lack or reduced induction of one or more of the BRM-dependent genes. Moreover, the level of induction observed for each BRM-dependent gene is an indirect marker for the potency of BRM induction.  A secondary goal of this project is to group these verified compounds based upon their relative site of action in the pathway of BRM induction. We will use a secondary assay to differentiate compounds affecting upstream and downstream sections in the regulatory pathway. A possible additional screen will then be optionally performed using cells harboring anti-HDAC2 shRNA (MGH2KD cells). Since the deacetylation of BRM is a requirement for function thus generating a luciferase signal in these reporter cells, only the compound(s) that affect higher-level regulatory genes (such as MAP kinase inhibition) will be identified with a positive result using this assay. For those compounds having an impact lower in the pathway, we will use them to determine if they inhibit BRN2, GATA3, HDAC3, MEF2D, or perhaps HDAC9, thereby assisting us in determining which motifs of the compound underlie the re-expression of BRM. After this series of screens, all hits will then undergo a series of secondary assays to determine how well they restore BRM expression and its function in BRM-deficient cell lines. The assay provider will explore these secondary MOA studies in additional collaboration beyond the scope of this CPDP.  References:  1. Bourachot, B., M. Yaniv, and C.

This assay relies on the fact that BRM assists the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in activating the MMTV promoter, which is used to drive expression of a luciferase reporter gene (7). Compounds active in this assay will restore BRM function, allowing the SWI/SNF-dependent GR to induce the MMTV promoter, leading to increased luciferase expression and well luminescence. MG213 cells are incubated in the presence of 0.1 uM Dexamethasone for 24 hours prior to be plated in 1536-well plates at 600 cells/well in 5 ul media with Dexamethasone using Kalypsys dispenser. The cells are immediately pinned with 45 nL of compound, control or DMSO, spun down, and incubated overnight at 37 C. Test compounds compound are delivered to the plates containing the MG213 cells and dexamethasone using pintool. Chembridge 5306793 is included as a positive control on each plate. OneGlo luciferase reagent is used according to the manufacturer's directions. Luminescence is measured using the Viewlux plate reader. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 9.1 uM. Note that the cell line used for this assay has been transduced with the E1A gene, which produces the viral oncoprotein, E1A. This protein sequesters Rb (and Rb2) protein thus preventing cellular growth inhibition. At lower densities, these newly modified cells have a more linear growth rate and do not lag when plated at low density. At higher densities (which typically impacts normal cell growth via contact inhibition), these cells maintain their growth rate allowing these cells to grow to higher densities. This modified cell line allows for a greater experimental range for this assay and improves its performance (consistency) as compared to the parental MG213 cells.  Protocol Summary:  The MG132 cell line was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of RPMI -1640 supplemented with 5% v/v certified fetal bovine serum, 500 ug/mL Geneticin, and 1X antibiotic mix (penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin).  Prior to the start of the assay 600 cells in a 5 ul volume of assay media (growth media as above except without geneticin and with 2.5% FBS and 0.1uM Dexamethasone) were dispensed into each well of 1536-well tissue culture-treated microtiter plates. The assay was started immediately by dispensing 45 nL of test compound in DMSO (0.69 % final DMSO concentration), DMSO alone, or CB5306793 to the appropriate wells. Next, the plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C (5% CO2, 95% RH). The assay was stopped by dispensing 5 ul of One Glo luciferase substrate to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes. Well luminescence was measured on the ViewLux plate reader.  The percent activation for each compound was calculated as follows:  %Activation = ( 1 - ( ( Test_Compound - Median_High_Control ) / ( Median_Low_Control - Median_High_Control ) ) ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing CB5306793.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally activating compounds in the Primary Screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent activation of test compound wells and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active. The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% of the highest observed primary activation value. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-6, and for inactive compounds 6-0.

Description:  The objective of this project is to identify small molecule probes that selectively activate the chymotrypsin-like serine protease kallikrein-7 (K7) zymogen. Although zymogens are widely processed by proteolytic removal of a propeptide, this mechanism of activation is difficult to control in biological systems. Consequently, the biological functions of many proteases remain obscure. The chymotrypsin-like serine protease K7 is secreted as an inactive proenzyme/zymogen and highly expressed in the skin, esophagus, and kidney and at lower levels in many organs including the brain (1-2). Kallikreins are thought to be part of a proteolytic program that mediates cleavage of cell adhesion proteins in skin, including cadherins, to mediate skin desquamation (3). K7 has attracted attention since it has been shown to play critical roles in skin diseases and tumor progression. Elevated K7 activity has been associated with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and a rare skin disease known as Netherton syndrome (4-5). In cancer, elevated K7 expression is strongly associated with increased tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis (6-8). Elevated K7 has been observed in multiple cancer types (6-7, 9). Ovarian cancer patients with high K7 expression have a significantly reduced overall mean survival time (9). K7 stimulates migration and invasion of cultured prostate carcinoma (7) and glioblastoma cells (8). In addition to demonstrated roles in cancer and skin disease, deficient K7 activity may be associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (10-11). In a global search of gene expression changes as a function of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) stage (Braak stage), kallikrein-7 was the only known peptidase transcript to decrease as stage progressed (10). Probe compounds that directly activate K7 without a requirement for proteolytic processing would serve as powerful tools to investigate the potential roles of K7 in amyloid beta and/or amyloid precursor protein processing. The chemical probes arising from this work could shed light on the functions of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in health and disease, and provide insights that enable development of new therapeutics for cancer, skin diseases, and Alzheimer's disease.

In this assay, compounds are incubated with K7 zymogen and an EDANS-DABCYL substrate probe that exhibits an increase in emission signal of the EDANS fluorophore upon complete proteolysis. As designed, test compounds that act as activators of K7 zymogen will hydrolyze the EDANS-DABCYL substrate, thereby decreasing the proportion of unhydrolyzed substrate probe in the well, and increasing the fluorescence emission. Compounds will be tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 7 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior the start of the assay 3 uL of Master Mix containing 5 nM K7ZYM (proKLK7) and 1 uM EDANS-DABCYL peptide substrate in Assay Buffer (50 mMTris,10 mM NaCl at pH 8.5) were added to all wells on columns 3-48. Three uL of the control mix containing 5 nM Active K7 (K7ZYM was activated following Vendor's protocol) and 1uM EDANS-DABCYL peptide substrate in Assay Buffer (previously incubated at 37 C for 2hrs) were added to all wells in columns 1-3. The assay started by the addition of 21 nl of compounds . Plates were centrifuged and fluorescence intensity was recorded (T0). Plates were incubated at room temperature for 4 hrs at which time fluorescence intensity (T4). Fluorescence intensity at T0 and T4 was read on a PerkinElmer EnVision using excitation wavelength 355 nm +/- 40nm, emission wavelength 520 nm +/- 8 nm and mirror wavelength cutoff 400 nm.  The % inhibition for each well at T0 and T4 was then calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing active K7. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.  The final % inhibition was calculated as follows:  Final_%_Inhibition = %_Inhibition_Test_Compound_T4 - %_Inhibition_Test_Compound_T0  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested , and (2) three times their standard deviation (taking into account only compounds which % inhibition was greater than the average minus three times the standard deviation of the low control % inhibition and smaller than the sum of average and three times the standard deviations of the high control % inhibition). The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment.  The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease.

Description:  Parasitic helminthes (worms) are a significant health and economic burden: over two billion people are infected by helminthes (1), and parasitic nematodes cause billions of dollars of crop damage each year in the United States (2). The developmental stages of these organisms are widely studied (3, 4). One stage, dauer (German for ""duration,"" also known as an alternative L3 larval stage) covers an alternative larval stage in which development stops and the worms enter a hibernation-like state in which they can survive extremely harsh environmental conditions, often for years. In the case of parasitic nematodes, this resting state is quite often the infectious state (5). As the burden of parasitic nematodes grows in the face of emerging resistance to the few existing antihelminthic agents, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the life cycles of parasitic worms so that new drugs may be developed (1). The nuclear receptor DAF-12 (for ""dauer formation""), first identified in C. elegans, is known to control many nematode species' entry into and exit from the dauer resting state (6). Daf-12 belongs to a family of over 30 genes which transduce environmental signals to influence the choice between dauer or reproductive development. Favorable environments activate insulin/IGF and TGF-beta pathways converge, leading to production of the steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA), which binds and activates Daf-12 (7). Currently available antihelminthic agents, to which resistance is beginning to emerge, act primarily on the feeding stages of the worms and have little effect on the infectious stages (8). Therefore, pharmacologic activators developed through high-throughput screening would be used both practically as nematicides and academically as tools to characterize the role of DAF-12 in modulating life cycle (8, 9).

In this assay, HEK293 cells are co-transfected with a DAF12-responsive reporter plasmid (lit1-tk-luc) and expression vector encoding hcDAF12. The ability of compounds to increase transcriptional activity is assessed by measuring luciferase expression from the reporter gene plasmid. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.8 uM.  Protocol Summary:  HEK293 cells were routinely cultured in T-175 flasks containing 25 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic mix at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, the HEK293 cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE reagents and seeded in fresh media at a density of 10 million cells per T175 flask. The following day, cells were transfected with 1 mL of serum-free OptiMEM containing 8 ug of the hcDAF12-expressing vector, 20 ug of the lit1-tk-luc reporter plasmid and 80 uL of transfection reagent. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of preheated TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM supplemented as above. Delta7-dafachronic acid (D7-DA), a well-characterized activator for hcDAF12, was used as a positive control.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, solid-bottom 1536-well plates using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora) and placed in the incubator for 3 hours. Cells were then treated with 34 nL/well of either test compounds, DMSO (Low Control, final concentration 0.68%) or 3 uM of D7-DA (High Control). Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95%RH and then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by addition of 5 uL of One-Glo reagent to each well. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent activation of each test compound was calculated as follows:  % Activation = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median__Low_Control ) )  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells treated with 3 uM Delta7 Dafachronic Acid Low_Control is defined as wells treated with DMSO only. Test_Compound is defined as wells treated with test compound.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally active compounds. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent activation of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % activation than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-12, and for inactive compounds 12-0.

Assay Overview: This work aims to develop a high-throughput assay to find/screen for specific inhibitors of SirT-5 which can be used to study the biological function of SirT-5.  This includes the function of two novel SirT-5 protein post-translational modifications, lysine succinylation and malonylation.  Expected Outcome: This assay utilizes a succinyl peptide conjugated to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), ISGASE(SuK)-AMC, where SuK represents succinyl lysine.  This substrate is not fluorescent by itself but is a substrate for SirT5 which catalyzes the removal of the succinyl group.  Loss of the succinyl group makes the substrate molecule suseptable to the trypsin cleavage, producing the fluorescent product 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) which results in an increase in fluorescenct signal.  Inhibitors of either SirT5 or trypsin will result in a decreased fluorescence emission.  Future expereiments will determine whether the active compounds inhibit the SirT5 reaction or whether they interfere with the subsequent tryspsin cleavage reaction.","1.) A 10 mM solution of ISGASE(SuK)-AMC is prepared as a DMSO stock solution.  This solution is diluted to a 20 uM working solution I with reaction buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 uM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, pH 7.4. 2.) A second working solution is prepared using the 90 uM stock SirT-5 solution by diluting the stock solution using PBS, pH 7.4 to a final concentration of 0.6 uM. 3.) The enzyme reaction is initiated by the simultaneous 2.5 uL additions of working solutions from #1 and #2 above into a 1536-well, black Aurora plate.  This results in a reaction with a final substrate ISGASE(SuK)-AMC concentration of 10 uM and a final SirT-5 concentration of 0.3 uM. 4.) The reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hr. at room temperature. 5.) 10X Trypsin (0.5% Trypsin-EDTA) is diluted to 1X (0.05%) by the addition of H20.  2.5 uL of 1X trypsin is then added to the reaction and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr (final trypsin concentration 0.0167% = 0.33X). 6.) After the 1 hr. incubation, the reaction progress is evaluated by monitoring the fluorescence emission at 460 nm.  This can be done using an Envision with 50/50 splitter, Ex. 380 nm and Em 460 nm.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  decreasing readout signal.  NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls Minus Inhibitors' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v10.0.2): The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to a normalized activity value of 0. The median raw signal of the intraplate positive control wells was set to a normalized activity value of -100. Experimental wells values were scaled to this range. All well activities were then multiplied by -1 to create a positive activity readout value range, to match Pubchem convention.   PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)' in Genedata (v10.0.2) was applied to the normalized plate data.  PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE: This was set as equal to the mean of the  normalized and corrected  sample replicate activities, rounded to the nearest integer . The minimum PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE required for a compound to be called a hit (the activity threshold, or AT) was set at 15.  PERCENTAGE OF ACTIVE REPLICATES: For each sample, the percentage of replicates (PCT_ACTIVE_REP) which had activity scores >= AT was determined. The minimum percentage of replicates required for a compound to be called a hit (PAR_T) was set at 100.

A 420 bp fragment of the rat TPO promoter that was sensitive to Pax8 levels in RMG-I ovarian cancer cells was stably introduced to create a reporter cell line (RMG-1:TPO-Luc)with a biologically-relevant context. Cells were treated with compound and controls for 24 hours.  Following compound treatment, TPO promoter activity (via luciferase light production) was measured using Promega SteadyGlo.  Expected Outcome:  If a compound inhibits Pax8 function, there will be less TPO expression in RMG-1 cells and this will lead to a decrease in luciferase signal.","PAX8 Primary Assay Protocol Cell maintenance and passaging: RMG-I-Pax8Luc cells: Stably express a Pax8-Luciferase reporter that contains a portion of the thyroperoxidase (TPO) gene promoter.

ERAP1 is required for trimming certain antigenic precursors after transport to the endoplasmic reticulum so that they can be bound by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and presented to cells of the immune system. Recently ERAP1 has been implicated in genome-wide association studies with ankylosing spondylitis and other autoimmune diseases. Chemical probes are necessary for understanding ERAP1's role in antigen selection and development of autoimmune disease. However, progress in this area currently is constrained by the lack of any chemical probes specific for ERAP1. Such probes would be useful in identifying the peptides targeted by the autoimmune T cells, for potential antigen-based tolerization therapy, for understanding the etiology of autoimmune disease, and could provide prototypes for potential therapeutic intervention based on inhibition of disease-specific antigen processing pathways. This assay is based on hydrolysis of the L-AMC amide bond liberating fluorescent 7-aminomethylcomarin (AMC). Inhibitors preventing this hydrolysis will result in a lower signal outcome.Related enzymes IRAP and ERAP2 will be used to test for selectivity in secondary assays. Autofluorescent compounds will be identified and filtered as necessary by taking T=0 and T= 60 minute reads.

Description:  Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze the addition of a methyl group from S- adenosylmethionine (SAM) to guanidino nitrogen atoms on arginine residues. Many biological processes are regulated by PRMTs, including transcription, DNA repair, RNA processing, and signal transduction (1-2). PRMT1 is the predominant arginine methyltransferase, accounting for > 85% of cellular PRMT activity. Aberrant PRMT1 activity has been associated with cardiovascular, malignant, infectious, and autoimmune disease, making it a viable therapeutic target for several indications (2-8). PRMT1 can modify and regulate several critical immunomodulatory proteins. Post-translational modifications within T cell receptor signaling cascades allow T lymphocytes to initiate a rapid and appropriate immune response to pathogens (9-12). Since there is every indication that PRMT1 (and other arginine methyltransferase family members) occupy key positions in signaling pathways of relevance to inflammatory and cell regulatory diseases, it is likely that a high-throughput assay for PRMT1-specific inhibition would be useful for new therapeutic lead identification. In this project, an activity-based maleimide probe that labels thiols will be used in a fluorescence polarization-based HTS assay to identify lead PRMT1 inhibitor compounds. Identification of specific PRMT inhibitors would provide us with important tools to probe the importance of PRMT activity in T helper cell function.  References:  1. Bedford, M. T.

In this assay, His-tagged recombinant PRMT1 protein is incubated with test compounds and Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as PRMT1 inhibitors will prevent PRMT1-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 2.79 uM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 4 uL of assay buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl and 0.05% Pluronic F-127) containing 0.55 uM of PRMT1 protein were dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 14 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.27% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 uL of 25 nM Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide in assay buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 60 minutes of incubation at 25 C, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a FITC FP filter set and a FITC dichroic mirror (excitation = 480 nm, emission = 540 nm). Fluorescence polarization was read for 40 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds. Test_Compound is defined as wells containing PRMT1 protein in the presence of test compound and Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, Alexa Fluor 488-maleimide but, no PRMT1 protein.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-6, and for inactive compounds 6-0.

Currently, the treatment for tumor angiogenesis focuses mainly on blocking VEGFR-2 signaling and has not been effective due to limited efficacy, eventually leading to resistance and/or relapse. COUP-TFII has been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis through modulating multiple angiogenic signals (VEGF/VEGFR-2, Angiopoietin 1/Tie2 and E2F-1) in many different types of cancer (13-14). In addition, COUP-TFII is overexpressed in prostate and several other cancers and is an excellent prognostic marker. By including COUP-TFII data with Cyclin D1, p21, PTEN, and Smad4 data in the prognosis, the prognostic accuracy is improved. The expression level of COUP-TFII and its role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis in prostate cancer has been examined, and these data indicate that COUP-TFII positively promotes prostate tumor growth and metastasis (15). These results provide the rational basis to posit that inhibition of COUP-TFII may offer a novel and broadly efficacious approach for anticancer intervention.  COUP-TFII has also been shown to regulate energy storage and expenditure. We have found that COUP-TFII heterozygous mice have increased mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipose tissue, which results in higher energy expenditure, resulting in resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity and improved glucose homeostasis due to increased insulin sensitivity at peripheral tissues (16). These results indicate that COUP-TFII has an important role in regulating adipocyte differentiation and energy metabolism. Therefore, COUP-TFII inhibitors could potentially serve as agents to improve insulin sensitivity, enhance energy metabolism, and decrease high fat diet-induced obesity.  References:  1.

The expression vectors for COUP-TFII (pcDNA6.2-COUP-TFII) and the luciferase reporter NGFIA-Luc (pXP2-168) are transiently cotransfected into HEK-293T cells.  COUP-TFII has been shown to efficiently activate NGFI-A-Luc expression (17) and the readout can be measured by a luminometer. Small molecules that inhibit COUP-TFII transcriptional activity will decrease the promoter activity that can be detected by luciferase assay. As designed, compounds that inhibit COUP-TFII activity will decrease luciferase activity, resulting in decreased well luminescence.  Protocol Summary:  HEK293 cells were routinely cultured in T-175 flasks containing 25 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic mix at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, the HEK293 cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE reagents and seeded in fresh media at a density of 10 million cells per T175 flask. The following day, cells were transfected with 1 mL of serum-free OptiMEM containing 12 ug of the plasmid encoding for COUP-TF2, 8 ug of the pX2-168 luciferase reporter plasmid, and 60 uL of X-tremeGene 9 transfection reagent. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of preheated TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 800,000 cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM supplemented as above. In the absence of a pharmacological positive control, COUP-TF2 inhibition was mimicked by transfecting cells in absence of the COUP-TF2 expressing vector (i.e. reporter plasmid only).  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, sterile, solid-bottom 1536-well plates. The first three columns received control cells (no COUP-TF2 expressed) whereas the rest of the plate was dispensed with COUP-TF2-transfected cells. After addition of cells the plates were spun down. The plates were incubated for 4 hours and then treated with 43 nL/well of test compounds or DMSO (final concentration 0.65%) on COUP-TF2 cells and Control cells. Plates were incubated for eighteen hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% RH. Plates were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by addition of 5 uL of One-Glo reagent to each well. After a 10 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Sample_Field ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Sample_Field ) ) * 100  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells containing cells transfected with reporter plamid only (pX2-168) Test_Compound is defined as well containing cells cotransfected with pcDNA6.2-COUP-TFII and pX2-168 in the presence of test compounds Sample_Field is defined as wells containing cells cotransfected with pcDNA6.2-COUP-TFII and pX2-168 in the presence of test compounds  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated for each assay plate: (1) the average percent inhibition of test compound wells that are within the High and Low Controls (i.e. higher than the average plues three standard deveiations of the Low Control wells and lower than the average minus three stardard deviation of the High Control wells) and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter for each plate, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than that particular plate's cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-34, and for inactive compounds 34-0.

Description:  Of all the somatic genome changes that accumulate during the pathogenesis of human cancers, only changes in DNA methylation appear to occur consistently (virtually all cases), to arise early (first appearing in preneoplastic lesions), and to be potentially reversible (the DNA sequence remains intact) (1-4). One such change in DNA methylation, increased CpG dinucleotide methylation at CpG islands encompassing the transcriptional regulatory regions of many genes, leads to the transcriptional ""silencing"" of critical cancer genes (2, 5-6). CpG island hypermethylation has been reported to inhibit gene transcription by interfering with the binding and/or function of transcriptional trans-activators, or by recruiting 5-meCpG-binding domain (MBD) family proteins capable of mediating transcriptional repression (7). As many as 500 or more genes are epigenetically ""silenced"" in most human cancers. Two MBD family proteins have been implicated in the silencing of genes carrying abnormally hypermethylated CpG island sequences, MECP2 and MBD2. MBD2 binds 5-meCpG-DNA and is a component of a 1 MD transcription repression complex that also contains a chromatin remodeling complex subunits, histone-binding proteins, and a helicase/ATPase domain (8). Evidence suggests that MBD2-containing complexes are responsible for transcriptional repression accompanying somatic hypermethylation at pi-class glutathione S-transferase 1 (GSTP1), the most common genome change yet reported for prostate cancer, and a common alteration in breast and liver cancers (9-11). The goal of this project is the discovery and characterization of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic gene silencing mediated by MBD2 and thus to identify compounds that will be able to reactivate the silenced genes in cancer cells, restoring gene function.

Pre-incubation of the MBD2 protein, FAM labeled methylated CpG oligo and Tb-labeled anti-His antibody leads to formation of a stable complex. Anti-his-complexed lanthanide (Tb) attaches to the anti-his-binding peptide tag on MBD2-DBD protein. When terbium donor is excited, Tb transfers energy to a fluorescein tag on the methylated oligo, now complexed with MBD2-DBD, resulting in an increase in TR-FRET. An inhibitor of the MBD2-DBD:FAM methylated CpG interaction will inhibit binding between MBD2 and FAM methylated oligo, leading to reduced energy transfer and reduced well FRET (fluorescein emission / Tb emission). Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 uM.  Protocol Summary:  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of Control Mix in assay buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.2% Tween-20) containing 25 nM of MBD2 protein, 30 nM of FAM labeled Unmethylated CpG DNA oligo and 5 nM of Terbium labeled anti-his antibody into columns 1 thru columns 3 of 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 5 uL of Experimental Mix containing 25 nM of MBD2 protein, 30 nM FAM labeled Methylated CpG DNA oligo and 5 nM Terbium labeled anti-his antibody in assay buffer were dispensed into columns 4 thru 48. Then, the plates were centrifuged and pinned with 22 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.44% final concentration). The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C and TR-FRET was measured on a Viewlux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 495 nm (Tb) and 525 nm (FAM). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I525nm / I495nm  Where:  I525nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 525 nm. I495nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 495 nm.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing the Experimental Mix in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing the Control Mix and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the Primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation.

This caspase substrate is a derivative of the fluorophore rhodamine 110 (R110). Peptides are covalently linked to each of the amino groups on R110, which suppresses the fluorescence of the dye. When the peptides are cleaved by the caspase, the substrate is converted first to the fluorescent monoamide and then to R110, with a further increase in fluorescence. The substrate can be used to continuously measure enzyme activity in cell extracts and purified enzyme preparations using a fluorometer or fluorescence microplate reader. When caspase 6 is inhibited there is a decrease in fluorescence as compared with the negative control wells.

The developmental stages of these organisms are widely studied [3, 4]. One stage, dauer (German for ""duration"", also known as an alternative L3 larval stage) covers an alternative larval stage in which development stops and the worms enter a hibernation-like state in which they can survive extremely harsh environmental conditions, often for years. In the case of parasitic nematodes, this resting state is quite often the infectious state [5]. As the burden of parasitic nematodes grows in the face of emerging resistance to the few existing antihelminthic agents, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the life cycles of parasitic worms so that new drugs may be developed [1]. The nuclear receptor DAF-12 (for ""dauer formation""), first identified in C. elegans, is known to control many nematode species' entry into and exit from the dauer resting state [6]. Daf-12 belongs to a family of over 30 genes which transduce environmental signals to influence the choice between dauer or reproductive development. Favorable environments activate insulin/IGF and TGF-beta pathways converge, leading to production of the steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA), which binds and activates Daf-12 [7]. Currently available antihelminthic agents, to which resistance is beginning to emerge, act primarily on the feeding stages of the worms and have little effect on the infectious stages [8]. Therefore, pharmacologic activators developed through high-throughput screening would be used both practically as nematicides and academically as tools to characterize the role of DAF-12 in modulating life cycle [8, 9].

In this assay, CV-1cells are co-transfected with a GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid (UAS-tk-luc) and expression vector encoding GAL4-hgDAF12. The ability of compounds to increase transcriptional activity is assessed by measuring luciferase expression from the reporter gene plasmid. Compounds were tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.8 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  HEK293 cells were routinely cultured in T-175 flasks containing 25 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1% v/v antibiotic-antimycotic mix at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity (RH). The day prior to run the assay, the HEK293 cells were harvested using 5 mL of TrypLE reagents and seeded in fresh media at a density of 10 million cells per T175 flask. The following day, cells were transfected with 1 mL of serum-free OptiMEM containing 8 ug of the hgDAF12-expressing vector, 20 ug of the MH1000-tk-luc reporter plasmid and 80 uL of transfection reagent. Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were harvested using 5 mL of preheated TrypLE and resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells per mL in phenol-red free DMEM supplemented as above. Sodium butyrate, a compound shown to increase the luminscent signal in this assay, was used as a positive control.  The assay was started by dispensing 5 uL of cell suspension into each well of white, solid-bottom 1536-well plates using a flying reagent dispenser (Aurora) and placed in the incubator for 3 hours. Cells were then treated with 34 nL/well of either test compounds, DMSO (Low Control, final concentration 0.68%) or 2 mM of Sodium Butyrate (High Control). Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 and 95%RH and then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes. Luciferase activity was detected by addition of 5 uL of One-Glo reagent to each well. After a 15 minute incubation time, light emission was measured with the ViewLux reader (PerkinElmer).  The percent activation of each test compound was calculated as follows:  %_Activation = 100 * ( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median__Low_Control ) )  Where:  High_Control is defined as wells treated with 2 mM Sodium Butyrate Low_Control is defined as wells treated with DMSO only. Test_Compound is defined as wells treated with test compound.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary activation. Negative % activation values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-12, and for inactive compounds 12-0.

One such change in DNA methylation, increased CpG dinucleotide methylation at CpG islands encompassing the transcriptional regulatory regions of many genes, leads to the transcriptional ""silencing"" of critical cancer genes (2, 5-6). CpG island hypermethylation has been reported to inhibit gene transcription by interfering with the binding and/or function of transcriptional trans-activators, or by recruiting 5-meCpG-binding domain (MBD) family proteins capable of mediating transcriptional repression (7). As many as 500 or more genes are epigenetically ""silenced"" in most human cancers. Two MBD family proteins have been implicated in the silencing of genes carrying abnormally hypermethylated CpG island sequences, MECP2 and MBD2. MBD2 binds 5-meCpG-DNA and is a component of a 1 MD transcription repression complex that also contains a chromatin remodeling complex subunits, histone-binding proteins, and a helicase/ATPase domain (8). Evidence suggests that MBD2-containing complexes are responsible for transcriptional repression accompanying somatic hypermethylation at pi-class glutathione S-transferase 1 (GSTP1), the most common genome change yet reported for prostate cancer, and a common alteration in breast and liver cancers (9-11). The goal of this project is the discovery and characterization of small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic gene silencing mediated by MBD2 and thus to identify compounds that will be able to reactivate the silenced genes in cancer cells, restoring gene function.

The UHRF1 gene encodes a member of a subfamily of RING-finger type E3 ubiquitin ligases. It contains a Set-and RING Associated (SRA) domain that binds to partially methylated DNA sequences during DNA synthesis. UHRF1 exhibits a different mode of DNA binding than MBD2, binding so-called hemi-methylated cytosines in order to promote their fully methylation. This assay is performed in a similar manner as the MBD2 screen, except that it employs recombinant UHRF1 SRA domain protein (UHRF1_SRA) and hemi-methylated DNA as its substrate. This assay monitors the ability of compounds to inhibit binding of cloned recombinant UHRF1_SRA to a FAM-labeled 14 bp hairpin oligonucleotide containing a hemimethylated CpG. In this biochemical assay, test compounds are incubated with UHRF1_SRA and a 5-carboxyfluorescene (FAM)-labeled 14bp hairpin DNA oligonucleotide containing one hemimethylated CpG dinucleotide in the presence of Tb-labeled anti-His antibody. An inhibitor of the UHRF1_SRA:FAM hemimethylated CpG interaction will inhibit binding between UHRF1 and FAM hemimethylated oligo, leading to reduced energy transfer and reduced well FRET (fluorescein emission / Tb emission). Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 4.4 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  The assay was started by dispensing 5 microliters of Control Mix in assay buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.2% Tween-20) containing 125 nanomolar of UHRF1 protein, 5 micromolar of FAM labeled methylated CpG DNA oligo and 5 nanomolar of Terbium labeled anti-his antibody into columns 1 thru columns 2 of 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 5 microliters of Experimental Mix containing 125 nanomolar of UHRF1 protein, 100 nanomolar FAM labeled Hemimethylated CpG DNA oligo and 5 nanomolar Terbium labeled anti-his antibody in assay buffer were dispensed into columns 3 thru 48. Then, the plates were centrifuged and pinned with 22 nL of test compound in DMSO, Mitoxantrone (1.3 micromolar final concentration) in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.44% final concentration). The plates were incubated for 60 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius and TR-FRET was measured on a Viewlux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland). After excitation at 340 nm, well fluorescence was monitored at 495 nm (Tb) and 525 nm (FAM). For each well, a fluorescence ratio was calculated according to the following mathematical expression: Ratio = I525nm / I495nm  Where:  I525nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 525 nm. I495nm represents the measured fluorescence emission at 495 nm.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated using as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing the Experimental Mix in the presence of test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing the Experimental Mix, Mitoxantrone and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported Pubchem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-19, and for inactive compounds 19-0.

Description:  Fibrin is an insoluble biopolymer that is formed by the proteolytic action of thrombin on the clotting factor fibrinogen. It constitutes the major protein component of blood clots and is generally associated with pathologies such as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis [for review see (1-4)]. Evidence of fibrin has also been found in most solid tumors (5-8). Recent studies indicate a link between the presence of fibrin(ogen) and metastatic potential (9-10). Because this protein represents such an important biomarker of disease, there exists a great need within the medical community to rapidly and reliably image fibrin by non-invasive means. One approach to solving this problem would be to identify small molecule motifs that exhibit fibrin-specific binding properties. When conjugated to an optical, magnetic resonance (MR), or radioactive tracer, such a species would permit the direct detection of fibrin in vivo by observing its accumulation at clot sites (11-12). The development of new fibrin-binding probes could also provide important insights into yet unknown biological roles that fibrin plays in various diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a solution-based assay using binding probe Tn6 that will identify novel fibrin-binding molecules that can be modified for application in the clinical imaging of thrombus (blood clot) in humans. Additionally, this project aims to develop a series of secondary biochemical assays in order to 1) validate those compounds that are indicated as potential hits by the primary screen and 2) eliminate compounds that exhibit non-specific binding behavior, acute toxicity, or other unfavorable properties.

In this assay, Fibrin-DD(E) protein is incubated with test compounds for a defined period, followed by addition of fluorescent probe fluorescein Tn7 (FITC-Tn7). The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. As designed, test compounds that bind to Fibrin-DD(E) will prevent Fibrin-DD(E)-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization.

Description:  Fibrin is an insoluble biopolymer that is formed by the proteolytic action of thrombin on the clotting factor fibrinogen. It constitutes the major protein component of blood clots and is generally associated with pathologies such as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis [for review see (1-4)]. Evidence of fibrin has also been found in most solid tumors (5-8). Recent studies indicate a link between the presence of fibrin(ogen) and metastatic potential (9-10). Because this protein represents such an important biomarker of disease, there exists a great need within the medical community to rapidly and reliably image fibrin by non-invasive means. One approach to solving this problem would be to identify small molecule motifs that exhibit fibrin-specific binding properties. When conjugated to an optical, magnetic resonance (MR), or radioactive tracer, such a species would permit the direct detection of fibrin in vivo by observing its accumulation at clot sites (11-12). The development of new fibrin-binding probes could also provide important insights into yet unknown biological roles that fibrin plays in various diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a solution-based assay using binding probe Tn6 that will identify novel fibrin-binding molecules that can be modified for application in the clinical imaging of thrombus (blood clot) in humans. Additionally, this project aims to develop a series of secondary biochemical assays in order to 1) validate those compounds that are indicated as potential hits by the primary screen and 2) eliminate compounds that exhibit non-specific binding behavior, acute toxicity, or other unfavorable properties.

In this assay, Fibrin-DD(E) protein is incubated with test compounds for a defined period, followed by addition of the fluorescent probe tetramethylrhodamine Tn6 (TRITC-Tn6). The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value. As designed, test compounds that bind to Fibrin-DD(E) will prevent Fibrin-DD(E)-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds will be tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 8.3 uM.  Protocol Summary: Displacement assay starts by the addition of Fibrin - DD(E) (final concentration 2uM) in assay buffer (50mM Tris base, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 7.8) to all wells, followed by the addition of equal volume of inhibitor peptide EP-2104R (final concentration 10uM) to high control wells and equal volume of assay buffer to sample wells and low control wells. Compounds in DMSO are transferred to plate and incubated for a period of 10 min, at which time TRITC-TN6 probe is added to all wells (final concentration of 0.1uM).

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease, caused by mutations in the gene coding for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). About 90% of people with CF have at least one copy of the ""F508del"" mutation (deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, or CFTR-F508del), and over 70% of CF patients are homozygous for this mutation. CFTR-F508del proteins are improperly folded, defective in trafficking to the plasma membrane, which results in the impairment of the channel functions. The mutated channel is still functional but is not present at the cell surface to achieve its normal functions. This assay aims to evaluate the correcting activity of small molecules on the function of CFTR-F508del. The correcting activity is determined by examining the fluorescence quenching ability of  human bronchial epithelial CFBE cells expressing CFTR-F508del as well as a halide-sensitive Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP). Compound(s) restoring CFTR-F508del function will allow additional mutated CFTR channels to be expressed at the cell surface resulting in an enhanced fluorescent quenching ability of these CFBE cells.   Expected outcome: Identify small molecules decreasing the fluorescence mediated by a halide-sensitive YFP present in CFBE cells expressing a mutated form of the human CFTR protein (F508del) by the quencher sodium iodide. Compounds reducing the fluorescence further down compared to the neutral control by at least 8% in duplicate will be considered as active hits.","Protocol:  Cystic Fibrosis airway epithelial cells (CFBE) have been transiently transfected (electroporation) with vectors containing an Yellow Fluoresencent Protein (YFP) halide-sensitive mutant and the human Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator with the deletion of the amino acid phenylalanine 508 (CFTR-F508del) provided by Dr. Jinliang Sui from the Flatley Discovery laboratory (Charlestown, MA).  Day 1 (Cell plating and compound pinning in assay plates)  Prior to perform the luciferase reporter assay experiments, the CFBE cells are thawed and reconstituted in MEM medium (Invitrogen, 11965) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco, 16140), 1X antibiotic (Penicillin/Streptamycin/Glutamine) (Gibco, Ref. no. 10378-016).  CFBE cells are then plated in 384-well format cell culture treated solid black wall clear bottom assay plates (Corning, Cat. # 3712) at a density of 6,000 cells/well using the multidrop dispenser (standard cassette)(Thermo Scientific) in a final volume of 50 ul. The assay plates are placed in 5% CO2 incubator where they are incubated for 2h at 37oC.  After 2h of incubation, the assay plates are pulled out of the incubator and are placed side by side on a pinning table adjacent to compound plates containing the MLPCN library and a sentinel plate containing 32 wells with the positive control C18. 100 nl of the compounds and the positive control C18  (final concentration 10 uM) are then collected on metal pins from these compound plates and transferred to the assay plate. The pins are washed with DMSO and methanol between each transfer. The assay plates are then moved back to the 5% CO2 incubator and incubated for an additional 24h.  Day 2 (Cell wash, CFTR channel activation, quenching and reading on the Flipr)  The assay plates are coming out of the incubator and washed once with PBS (50 ul) using a Biotek plate washer and 20ul of  20 uM Forskolin (Cayman Chemicals) and 3uM potentiator P3 (final concentration) in DPBS is added to the assay plate for 1h at 37oC. Then, the assay plates are cooled down for 30 minutes at room temperature and 25 ul of YFP quencher sodium iodide (72.5 mM final concentration) in DPBS is added and the fluorescence is measured every second for one minute on the Flipr tetra (Molecular Devices).

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Active compounds result in  decreasing readout signal.  NORMALIZATION: The raw signals of the plate wells were normalized using the 'Neutral Controls' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v10.0.2): The median raw signal of the intraplate  neutral controls (NC) is set to a normalized activity value of 0. A normalized activity value of 100 is defined as (2)(NC). A normalized activity value of -50 is defined as (0.5)(NC). Experimental wells values were scaled to this range. All well activities were then multiplied by -1 to create a positive activity readout value range, to match Pubchem convention.   PATTERN CORRECTION:  The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Runwise Pattern (Multiplicative)' in Genedata (v10.0.2) was applied to the normalized plate data.

Description: Serine hydrolases play key roles in mammalian signaling networks and are particularly enriched in the nervous system, where they have been shown to regulate the metabolism of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and the endocannabinoids. The development of selective inhibitors for such hydrolytic enzymes has facilitated our understanding of the role that neurotransmitters play in vivo [1]. Recently, alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing 4 (ABHD4) was identified as the principle biosynthetic enzyme of the endocannabinoid anandamide [2]. Anandamide is an endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors and a well-characterized mediator of many physiological processes including inflammation, pain, and appetite [3]. Despite considerable advances in our understanding of anandamide degradation system, the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of anandamide have remained enigmatic. ABHD4 produces Glycerophospho-N-acyl Ethanolamine (GP-NAE), a precursor of anandamide [2]. Since disruption of anandamide signaling has proven therapeutically beneficial [3], the development of the first potent and selective ABHD4 inhibitors would not only provide crucial tools to advance our understanding of the complex metabolic network that supports the endocannabinoid system in vivo, but also offer a new drug target for a range of human disorders such as obesity.

Next, 4 microliters of assay buffer containing 46.9 ug/mL of ABHD4 mutant protein (S159A) were dispensed into columns 1 and 3 of 1536 microtiter plates and 4 microliters of assay buffer containing 46.9 ug/mL of ABHD4 wild type protein were dispensed into columns 4 thru 48. Then, 45 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.89% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 45 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 188 nM FP-Rh in assay buffer to all wells.

Description:  Approximately 20-30% of breast cancer patients have tumors that over-express human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which confers an aggressive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis [1-3]. A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) proteases are responsible for amplification of HER2 signaling due to either cleavage of its extracellular domain or release of HER2 ligands, which leads to proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [4, 5]. ADAM proteases implicated in amplification of HER2 signaling [6, 7] are ADAM10 [8, 9] and 17 [10, 11]; therefore, inhibition of these proteases represents a viable approach to the abrogation of HER2 signaling in breast cancer. The specific aims of this proposal, therefore, will focus on (1) screening of the MLPCN library for inhibitors that interact with exosites of ADAM10 and 17, and (2) medicinal chemistry optimization of initial leads in order to develop molecular probes of ADAM10 and 17. Our laboratory is uniquely positioned to achieve these goals due to expertise in development of exosite-binding inhibitors and probes, HTS, and biochemistry of proteases. We will also collaborate with experts in the fields of peptide synthesis, HTS, and medicinal chemistry. The successful completion of the Aims of this proposal will lead to a discovery of novel, potent, and selective small molecule probes for ADAM10 and 17[12]. Using these selective molecular probes alone or in combination with other tools, such as siRNA, antibodies, and other small molecule inhibitors, the researchers will be able to study contributions not only of individual members of the ADAM protease family, but also the interplay of ADAM protease-controlled pathways with other pathways implicated in the progression of breast cancer [13-15].

This assay employs a fluorophore and quencher pair. F =EDANS fluorophore, Q = DABCYL quencher. When intact, EDANS emission at 460nm is quenched by DABCYL via fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Upon cleavage of the scissile bond (A~V) by ADAM protease, the distance between fluorophore and quencher increases resulting in fluorescence increase at 460nm. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal final nominal concentration of 6.95 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters 2X ADAM10 enzyme (20 nM in Assay Buffer: 50 mM HEPES, 0.01% Brij, pH 7.5) are dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Compounds are added to plate (final concentration TBD) and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay is started by dispensing 2.5 microliter of2X DM2 substrate (20 uM in Assay Buffer) to all wells. Plates are centrifuged and after 3 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence is measured (excitation = 359nm, emission = 460nm).  The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells treated with 1 micromolar Marimastat Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.  Interval Cutoff:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Four values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all high controls tested plus three times the standard deviation of the high controls, (2) the average percent inhibition of all low controls tested minus three times the standard deviation of the low controls, (3) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested between (1) and (2), and (4) three times their standard deviation. The sum of two of these values, (3) and (4), was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition/activity than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-19, for inactive 19-0.

In humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is either sporadic, affecting mainly people over 60 years, iatrogenic, or genetic with a high penetrance. Prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation, in brain and lymphoid tissue of PrPsc [2], a misfolded, aggregated form of the host prion protein PrP [3, 4]. PrPsc is thought to be the main or only constituent of the prion, the infectious agent [5-8]. PrP is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein of 254 amino acids attached to the cell surface in microdomains known as lipid rafts [9-11], and tends to aggregate into rod-like structures. The encoded protein contains a highly flexible region of five tandem octapeptide repeats. Mutations in the repeat region as well as elsewhere in this gene have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Gerstmann-Straussler disease.  Prion replication is based on the structural conversion of the host prion protein into its harmful misfolded counterpart. In the sporadic form of CJD, the initial misfolding of PrP may be a rare, stochastic event. In familial CJD, this event is triggered by certain mutations in the protein. When the disease is transmitted, PrPsc acts as a template and ""seeds"" the misfolding of the host PrP. Prion diseases are not curable and the survival time is typically 6 to 12 months after the onset of symptoms. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, is transmissible to humans [12, 13]. While about 200 individuals are known to have succumbed to ""human BSE"" (variant CJD), the number of infected but as yet asymptomatic people is unknown because there is no preclinical diagnostic test for prion diseases and the incubation time may extend to decades; this is of particular concern because the disease is transmissible by blood transfusion. As a result, the identification of compounds that suppress cell surface PrP and thereby suppress prion replication may provide useful tools for the therapy of prion diseases, and for study of PrP biosynthetic and cellular trafficking pathways.

This assay detects PrPc on the surface of living LD9 fibroblast cells using two PRPC-specific antibodies which carry donor and acceptor fluorophores, respectively.  In this assay, the antibodies are directed against distinct, non-overlapping PrPc epitopes. Antibody occupancy of both epitopes of a PrPc molecule results in FRET signal emission. Free antibody or single antibody occupancy is not detected. The assay employs long half-life lanthanide donors (Europium or Terbium cryptate) and acceptor fluorophores XL665 or d2: SAF32 (aa53-93) and D18 (aa133-157) labeled with the donor and acceptor fluorophores, respectively. Ratios of 665 nm to 620 nm measurements are calculated, to take into account non-specific absorption of 620 nm light by the assay matrix. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 13.8 microM.  Protocol Summary:  The LD9 cell line (subclone of L929, which is a mouse fibroblast cell line) was routinely cultured in T-175 sq cm flasks at 37 C and 95% relative humidity (RH). The growth media consisted of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (no phenol red) supplemented with 5% v/v Bovine Growth Serum Supplemented Calf and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin.  The day before the assay, 3 uL of cell growth media was dispensed into the first two columns of 1536 well microtiter plates and 1500 cells in 3 uL of cell growth media were seeded into the remaining wells. Next, 42 nL of test compound in DMSO, Brefeldin A (58 uM final concentration) in DMSO, or DMSO alone (1.38% final concentration) were dispensed to the appropriate wells. The plates were then incubated for 21 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 95 % RH.  The assay was started by adding 1 uL of SAF32-Tb at a final concentration of 0.072ug/mL and 1ul of D18-d2 at a final concentration of 0.66ug/mL to all wells, respectively. Labeled Antibodies were prepared in 1X PBS. Plates were centrifuged and after 3 hours of incubation at room temperature, well TRFRET was read on a ViewLux microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland). Measurements were performed by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 618 nm (Tb) and 671 nm (d2) with the ViewLux microplate reader.  To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = I671nm / I618nm  Where:  I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nm.  The percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Low_Control ) ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing cells, test compounds and DMSO. High_Control is defined as wells containing cells, Brefeldin A and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-18, and for inactive compounds 18-0.

Description:  Approximately 20-30% of breast cancer patients have tumors that over-express human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which confers an aggressive tumor phenotype and poor prognosis [1-3]. A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease (ADAM) proteases are responsible for amplification of HER2 signaling due to either cleavage of its extracellular domain or release of HER2 ligands, which leads to proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [4, 5]. ADAM proteases implicated in amplification of HER2 signaling [6, 7] are ADAM10 [8, 9] and 17 [10, 11]; therefore, inhibition of these proteases represents a viable approach to the abrogation of HER2 signaling in breast cancer. The specific aims of this proposal, therefore, will focus on (1) screening of the MLPCN library for inhibitors that interact with exosites of ADAM10 and 17, and (2) medicinal chemistry optimization of initial leads in order to develop molecular probes of ADAM10 and 17. Our laboratory is uniquely positioned to achieve these goals due to expertise in development of exosite-binding inhibitors and probes, HTS, and biochemistry of proteases. We will also collaborate with experts in the fields of peptide synthesis, HTS, and medicinal chemistry. The successful completion of the Aims of this proposal will lead to a discovery of novel, potent, and selective small molecule probes for ADAM10 and 17[12]. Using these selective molecular probes alone or in combination with other tools, such as siRNA, antibodies, and other small molecule inhibitors, the researchers will be able to study contributions not only of individual members of the ADAM protease family, but also the interplay of ADAM protease-controlled pathways with other pathways implicated in the progression of breast cancer [13-15].

This assay employs a fluorophore and quencher pair. F =EDANS fluorophore, Q = DABCYL quencher. When intact, EDANS emission at 460nm is quenched by DABCYL via fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Upon cleavage of the scissile bond (A~V) by ADAM protease, the distance between fluorophore and quencher increases resulting in fluorescence increase at 460nm. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 6.95 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2.5 microliters 2X ADAM17 enzyme (20 nM in Assay Buffer: 50 mM HEPES, 0.01% Brij, pH 7.5) are dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates. Compounds are added to plate (final concentration TBD) and incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay is started by dispensing 2.5 microliter of2X DM2 substrate (20 uM in Assay Buffer) to all wells. Plates are centrifuged and after 3 hours of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence is measured (excitation = 359nm, emission = 460nm).  The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( RFU_Test_Compound - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) / ( MedianRFU_High_Control - MedianRFU_Low_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells treated with 1 micromolar Marimastat Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO.   Interval Cutoff: A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Four values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all high controls tested plus three times the standard deviation of the high controls, (2) the average percent inhibition of all low controls tested minus three times the standard deviation of the low controls, (3) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested between (1) and (2), and (4) three times their standard deviation. The sum of two of these values, (3) and (4), was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition/activity than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-8, for inactive 8-0.

Description:  Extracellular stimuli including hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters promote activation of phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes and cleavage of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) into the classical second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP3) [1]. These second messengers coordinately control numerous signaling cascades through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and the activation of protein kinase C. Aberrant regulation of PLCs contribute to diverse human diseases including cancer [2-4], cardiovascular diseases [5-6], and neuropathic pain [7], as well as schizophrenia and epilepsy [5, 8-9]. Consequently, small molecule PLC inhibitors will be valuable pharmacological tools to dissect the roles of PLCs in development and disease, and could potentially serve as candidates for drug development.

DNA-protein crosslinks [1, 2]. Drugs targeting these enzymes act by stabilizing the crosslinks, producing a covalent DNA-protein complex [3, 4]. Despite their clinical efficacy, drugs that target TopII (TopII poisons) may lead to negative side-effects, including secondary malignancies. The repair of TopII-DNA complexes is poorly understood. Recently, a human 5?- tyrosine phosphodiesterase (hTDP2) has been identified for the excision of TopII-DNA adducts [5, 6]. As hTDP2 repairs the cytotoxic adducts produced by TopII poisons, it is likely that effective inhibition of hTDP2 can be targeted to improve the efficacy of TopII poisons and reduce the side-effects. It has been shown that the knockdown/knockout of TDP2 activity in A549 (non-small cell lung cancer cell line, NSCLC) and DT40 cells increased sensitivity to the TopII targeting agent etoposide, demonstrating that hTDP2 can be a target for adjuvant chemotherapy [7]. Our hypothesis is effective inhibition of hTDP2 will increase the cancer cell killing efficacy of TopII poisons like etoposide [8]. Therefore, hTDP2 inhibitor screening, especially in a high-throughput manner, will expedite drug discovery.  References:  1. Corbett, K.D. and J.M.

TDP2 is a divalent cation-dependent enzyme that repairs TopII-associated DNA strand breaks. It is hypothesized that inhibitors of TDP2 may serve as useful adjuvants in combination with cancer drugs such as etoposide.  In this biochemical assay, recombinant human TDP2 protein is incubated at 37 degrees Celsius with the T5PNP substrate in the presence of Mg2+-containing assay buffer.T5PNP is a substrate for snake venom phosphodiesterase, as well as a substrate for TDP2. As a substrate for TDP2, T5PNP is used to mimic the TopII-DNA complex. TDP2 cleaves the phosphodiester bond in T5PNP, and the chromogenic p-nitrophenol group is released. As time increases the TDP2 enzyme will increasingly catalyze hydrolysis of the T5PNP substrate, resulting in increased release of p-nitrophenol and detection at 415nM wavelength. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a final nominal concentration of 12.8microM.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2 ul of a solution containing T5PNP subtrate (final concentration 5mM) in assay buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1mM DTT, 1mM MgCl2, 50mM KCl and 100ug/ml BSA) was dispended into a all wells of a 1536 well plate. Next, 39nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (1% final concentration) was added to the appropriate wells. The assay was started by dispensing 1 ul of a solution contanting TDP2 enzyme (120nM final concentration) in assay buffer to wells in columns 4-48 and 1ul of assay buffer alone to wells in columnes 1-3. Plates were centrifuged and incubated for 2hrs at 37 degrees Celsius at which time fluorescence intensity was measured (Ex. 405nm and Em. 405nm) using a EnVision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate Epi Absorbance (EPIABS)  EPIABS = -log10( sample / background)  Where:  Sample is defined as the fluorescent intensity of wells containing test compounds or DMSO. Background is defined as the fluorescent intensity of wells containing buffer and T5PNP only.  The % inhibition for each well was then calculated as follows:  %_Inhibition = ( EPIABS_Test_Compound - MedianEPIABS_Low_Control ) / ( MedianEPIABS_High_Control - MedianEPIABS_Low_Control ) * 100  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound, TDP2 and T5PNP. High_Control is defined as wells containing only Buffer and T5PNP. Low_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, TDP2 and T5PNP.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-22, and for inactive compounds 22-0.

Description:  Extracellular stimuli including hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters promote activation of phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes and cleavage of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) into the classical second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP3) [1]. These second messengers coordinately control numerous signaling cascades through the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and the activation of protein kinase C. Aberrant regulation of PLCs contribute to diverse human diseases including cancer [2-4], cardiovascular diseases [5-6], and neuropathic pain [7], as well as schizophrenia and epilepsy [5, 8-9]. Consequently, small molecule PLC inhibitors will be valuable pharmacological tools to dissect the roles of PLCs in development and disease, and could potentially serve as candidates for drug development.

In this assay, PLC-B3 isozyme is incubated with test compounds and fluorogenic reporter WH-15. As designed, test compounds that act as PLC-B3 inhibitors will prevent the hydrolysis of WH-15 fluorogenic reporter, thus preventing the release of IP3, a quinomethide derivative, and 6-aminoquinoline, which is highly fluorescent, leading to decreasing well fluorescence. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal test concentration of 12.2 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2 microliters of PLC-B3 at a final concentration of 0.4ng/ul (in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 70 mM KCl, 3mM CaCL2, 3mM EGTA, 2mM DTT, 0.04mg/mL acid-free BSA, with Cholate 0.5%) are dispensed into 1536 microtiter plates, 1 microliter of assay buffer is dispensed into columns 4-48 and 1 microliter of 0.2M EGTA is added to columns 1-3. Compounds are added to plate (final concentration 12.2uM) and incubated for 10 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay start by the addition of 2 microliter of WH-15 fluorogenic reporter at a final concentration 10uM in Assay Buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 90 min of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius fluorescence is measured at 355nm excitation and 535nm emmision.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 *( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing PLCB3 in the presence of test compound and WH15 fluoreogenic reporter. High_Control is defined as wells containing PLCB3, WH15 fluoreogenic reporter and EGTA. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds.  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Four values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all high controls tested plus three times the standard deviation of the high controls, (2) the average percent inhibition of all low controls tested minus three times the standard deviation of the low controls, (3) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested between (1) and (2), and (4) three times their standard deviation. The sum of two of these values, (3) and (4), was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition/activity than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

The human and economic cost of antibiotic resistance is enormous. Despite the urgent need to develop new antibiotics, only four classes have been launched since 1970. Among hundreds of essential enzymes in the bacterial cell, the ribosome is an evolutionary preferred antibiotic target. Approximately half of all known natural antibiotics and a large fraction of clinical antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with translation. The ribosome is a 2.5-megadalton ribonucleoprotein complex composed of a small and a large subunit. RNA is the main structural and functional component of the ribosome, and most of the clinical translation inhibitors interact directly with ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The redundancy of rRNA genes in bacterial genomes makes it difficult for the bacterium to develop resistance by mutating the site of drug action. Therefore, clinical resistance arises mainly from acquisition of natural resistance genes circulating in microbial communities. Many of these genes code for enzymes that target the ribosomal sites of action of natural antibiotics. For example, the Erm methyltransferases modify 23S rRNA at a specific residue (A2058 in E. coli), rendering bacteria resistant to macrolides, lincosamides and the streptogramin B group of antibiotics by impairing their binding to the ribosome. One of the most recently marketed ribosome inhibitors is linezolid (FDA-approved in 2000). Because of its synthetic nature, it held the promise of evading natural resistance mechanisms. However, it has been shown that linezolid acts upon the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), a ribosomal site that is targeted by several classes of natural translation inhibitors. In 2007, we described the first clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to develop linezolid resistance by acquisition of a natural resistance gene, cfr. This gene encodes an rRNA methylase that targets the nucleotide A2503 in the PTC. Cfr likely originated from a bacterial producer of a natural PTC inhibitor to resist its action.  We engineered several bacterial strains that express a hybrid ribosome in which the site of interest was mutated to mimic the counterpart sequence of the human cytoplasmic ribosome. Because the humanized  strains express a fluorescent protein different from that of the wild-type bacterial strain, strains will be grown in a mixed culture. Compounds that selectively inhibit the growth of the wild-type strain, but not the humanized  strain, likely act on the target ribosomal site, because the resistant humanized strain contains mutations at that site. Because of the nature of selection, we expect the compounds identified here to be selective protein  synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit bacterial growth by acting upon a novel ribosomal site.   Assay Overview:  We engineered several bacterial strains that express a hybrid ribosome in which the site of interest was mutated to mimic the counterpart sequence of the human cytoplasmic ribosome.

Because of the nature of selection, we expect the compounds identified here to be selective protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit bacterial growth by acting upon a novel ribosomal site.   Expected Outcome: Compounds that reduce GFP (wild type ribosome-expressing GFP-labeled E. coli) significantly (2x) greater than RFP (at least one of five strains of mutant humanized ribosome-expressing RFP-labeled E. coli) and do not significantly reduce total OD600 (< 30% inhibition) will be considered selective inhibitors.  The exact mutant RFP strain that is spared will be deconvoluted in subsequent assays.","Bac rRNA Automation Protocol Day 1: 1. Grow each E. coli strain (one wild type (GFP) and six humanized mutants (RFP) including the control G2058) individually. Pick each strain  into a separate 50 mL conical tube with 10 mL of LB medium supplemented with 100 ug/mL amplicillin and 50 ug/mL spectinomycin.  2. Incubate strains overnight at 37 degrees with shaking at 190 RPM. Day 2: 1. In the morning, check OD600 of the cultures. 2. Dilute the cultures to OD 600 = 0.05 in LB medium supplanted with 100 ug/mL ampicillin.  3. Return strains to 37 degrees with shaking at 190 RPM for about 3. 5 hours. Grow strains to reach OD 600 about 0.5 (exponential growth phase). 4. Mix strains (final OD600= 0.02) in the proportion 50% wild-type, 8.33% each of the six mutants in LB medium supplemented with 100 ug/mL ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG (which is used to induce expression of fluorescent proteins). 5. Dispense 30 uL/well of bacteria mixture to 384 well Assay Ready Plates (ARPs) containing positive controls (Erythromycin 15 mg/mL, 50 nL in column 1 and Choramphenicol 15 mg/mL, 50 nL in column 23). 6. Place breathable film on plate using Plate Loc. 7. Incubate plates in Steristore at 37 degrees, 0% CO2 for 24 hours, 95% humidity. Day 3: 1. Remove assay plate from Steristore. 2. Remove breathable film with X-Peel. 3. Read GFP signal using EnVision plate reader (mirror: FITC #403, Ex: FITC 485 #102, Em: FITC 535 #206). 4. Read RFP signal using EnVision plate reader (mirror: BODIPY TMR #405, Ex: photometric  550 #312, Em: Cy3 595 #229). 5. Read OD600 signal using EnVision plate reader (Ex: Photometric 600 #319). 6. Store plate in Steristore incubator. Equipment Required Combi Plate Loc Steristore  (37 C, 95% humiodity, 0% CO2,) X-Peel 2 EnVisions","PRESENCE OF CONTROLS: Neutral control wells (NC) and positive control  wells (PC) were included on every plate. One positive control,  Chloramphenicol, was used to determine the baseline fluorescence and OD  as it was expected to non-selectively kill all 6 strains, GFP wild-type  and RFP mutant. The other positive control, Erythromycin, was expected  to selectively spare one RFP control strain (G2058) and was therefore  used as a guideline for calculating the performance of a selective GFP  inhibitor.   NORMALIZATION:  Each of three layers was independently normalized using the 'Neutral  Controls' method in Genedata Assay Analyzer (v7.0.3):  The median raw signal of the intraplate neutral control wells was set to  a normalized activity value of 0.  The a raw signal of 0 was set to a normalized activity value of -100.  Experimental wells values were scaled to this range.   PATTERN CORRECTION: The plate pattern correction algorithm 'Assay  Pattern (multiplicative)' in Genedata (v7.0.3) was applied to the  normalized plate data for each layer.   AGGREGATE COMPOUND LAYER SCORING: In addition to the reported normalized  percent activities above, each replicate compound measurement was  converted to a z-score relative to the corresponding DMSO-control  distribution, as described for ChemBank (Seiler et al., 2008). ChemBank  composite Z scores were computed to combine replicates for each channel  (RFP, GFP, and OD). We sought compounds that affected the GFP-expressing  wild-type strain while not affecting at least one of the mutant RFP  strains and not affecting overall viability as measured by OD; i.e.,  they score with negative composite Z in the GFP channel with little or  no effect in the RFP or OD channels. To combine the results of the three  channels quantitatively, we defined a trigonometric scaling function to  express our preferences that (1) GFP composite Z scores be negative, and  (2) RFP and OD composite Z score amplitudes exceed GFP composite Z score  amplitudes; such compounds should fall left of the DMSO-control  distribution, but above the main diagonal in a plot of GFP composite Z  versus either OD or RFP composite Z. Using the two ratios of ChemBank  composite Z scores (GFP/RFP and GFP/OD), we defined q1 = arctan(GFP/RFP)  and q2 = arctan(GFP/OD) and expressed our scale factor as F =  cos(-q1)cos(2q1)cos(-q2)cos(2q2), with the four factors respectively  expressing our preferences. As a three-assay composite score, we take  -(ZGFP) x F, which clearly discriminates the compounds of interest when  plotted against RFP or OD.   PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_SCORE: The above three-assay composite score was  normalized on a scale of 1-100, with 1 being those with the least  desirable observed score representing compounds increasing in GFP signal  and decreasing in RFP or OD, and 100 being the most ideal observed score  representing a loss in GFP with no change in RFP or OD.   PUBCHEM_ACTIVITY_OUTCOME: The above three-assay composite scores were  fit to a standard distribution and a corresponding Holm-Bonferroni  corrected p value significance was calculated. Compounds with a FDR  corrected p value less than 0.05, normalized OD percent score > -30,  negative GFP composite Z score, and the expression Abs(Cos(-q)Cos(2q)) >  (sqrt2)/2 for both q1 and q2 were assigned a score of 2 (active).  Compounds failing any of these criteria were assigned a score of 1  (inactive.)",,,,,HTS for Bacterial rRNA inhibitors Measured in Microorganism-Based System Using Plate Reader - 7056-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,Broad Institute,7056-01_Inhibitor_SinglePoint_HTS_Activity,"NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network, Assay Provider",Primary Screening,2013-10-29,,351244,5501,345743,348128,5500,342664,1.2,Live,,,,cell-based format,cell growth assay,fluorescence method

Description:  Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) are a class of enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2 ester of glycerophospholipids to release a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid [1]. Secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease in humans. Inhibitors of many of the sPLA2s in the human and mouse genome have been made, but to date no inhibitor of human group III sPLA2 (hGIII-sPLA2) has been discovered. The amino acid sequence of hGIII-sPLA2 is similar to that of the sPLA2 in honey bee venom. This enzyme was discovered about 10 years ago, cloned, its enzymatic properties studied, and a knockout mouse constructed [2]. Over the past few years it has been shown that this enzyme is highly expressed in mast cells [3]. The enzyme is secreted from human and mouse mast cells and, together with lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase, leads to PGD2 production. Presumably the sPLA2 liberates arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids to provide the arachidonic acid for PGD2 production. PGD2 then binds to its receptor (DP1) on the surface of mast cells leading to mast cell maturation. Mice lacking mGIII-sPLA2 produce immature mast cells [4]. These mice show a dramatic reduction in anaphylatic responses, a process that is well known to be mediated in part by mast cells. The results provide a strong rational for the development of GIII-sPLA2 inhibitors to treat mast cell-mediate diseases.  References:  1. Lambeau G, Gelb MH.

Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 2 microliters of assay buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.9, 100mM NaCl and 1mM CaCl2) were dispensed into columns 1 thru column 3 of 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 2 microliters of assay buffer containing 2.63ug/mL of HGIII-sPLA2 enzyme were dispensed into columns 4 thru 48. Then, 37 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (1.2% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 15 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius. The assay start by the addition of 1 microliter of 9 uM BODIPY PC-A2 substrate incorporated in liposomes containing 45 uM DOPC and 45 uM DOPG in assay buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 35 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence was measured at 485nm excitation and 535nm emission.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  %Inhibition= 100*( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing HGIII-SPLA2 enzyme in the presence test compound and BODIPY PC-A2 substrate. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, BODIPY PC-A2 but, no HGIII-SPLA2 enzyme.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Four values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all high controls tested plus three times the standard deviation of the high controls, (2) the average percent inhibition of all low controls tested minus three times the standard deviation of the low controls, (3) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested between (1) and (2), and (4) three times their standard deviation. The sum of two of these values, (3) and (4), was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition/activity than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The PubChem Activity Score range for active compounds is 100-20, and for inactive compounds 20-0.

Description:  HIV-1 integrase (IN) is an important therapeutic target in the fight against AIDS as its function is essential for viral replication. Multimeric IN catalyzes pair-wise integration of the linear viral DNA ends in a two-step reaction. The main novelty of the current approach is to discover new probes that stabilize functionally compromised IN multimers rather than interfere with IN multimerization (referred to as MINIs [multimeric IN inhibitors]). LEDGF/p75 is the principal cellular binding partner of HIV-1 IN and is essential for effective integration. Selective LEDGF/p75-IN inhibitors are referred to as LINIs. Using an in vitro model system we have demonstrated that HIV-1 IN is a highly dynamic protein and its ordered, temporal assembly with cognate DNA and cellular co-factor LEDGF/p75 is essential for catalytic activities (1-3). To form the stable and functional IN-viral DNA complex, individual IN subunits need to assemble in the presence of viral DNA. LEDGF/p75 promotes IN multimerization in the absence of viral DNA, however these preformed IN multimers are catalytically inactive (2-3). Since LEDGF/p75 is required for effective concerted integration in infected cells, it has been speculated that LEDGF/p75 engages preintegration complexes (PICs) only after the stable IN-viral DNA complex is formed. Our novel primary assay of LEDGF/p75-dependent integration will capture both MINIs and LINIs, whereas the two secondary assays of IN multimerization and IN-LEDGF/p75 binding will delineate these two classes of probes.

The main novelty of our approach is to discover new probes that stabilize functionally compromised IN multimers rather than interfere with IN multimerization. Here we refer to such probes as MINIs (multimeric IN inhibitors). Discovery of MINIs through HTS will provide a new and powerful tool for structural and mechanistic studies to elucidate how different multimeric forms of IN interact with viral DNA as well as viral and cellular proteins at different stages of viral replication.  In this assay, test compounds are incubated with IN, followed by addition of DNA Substrates (50nM viral DNA-Cy5, 10nM target DNA substrate final concentrations) and LEDGE/p75 (100nM final concentration). After 30 min incubation Streptavidin-EuCryptate (2nM) is added to the wells. Plates are incubated for 2.5hrs after which HTRF is measured. As designed, compounds that prevent or inhibit IN multimerization will reduce the transfer of energy from Eu to Cy5, thereby inhibiting well FRET. Compounds will be tested in singlicate at a nominal concentration of 3.7 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 1.5 uL of HIV1-Integrase (100nM final concentration) in assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, buffer containing 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Brij-35, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) and 1.5ul of Assay buffer to High Control wells. Next, 11 nl of compounds or DMSO alone (0.25% final concentration) were distributed into appropiate wells. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 25 C. The assay started by the addition of 1.5 ul of a mixture containing substrate DNA, viral DNA and LEDGF-p75. The plates were incubated for 2.5hrs at 25 C, after which 3ul of Streptavidin-Eu Cryptate was added to all wells to a final concentration of 1nM in detection buffer (20mM EDTA, 0.05% Brij35, 0.1mg/ml BSA). Plates were incubated for 1 hr, at which time TR-FRET was measured by the ViewLux microplate reader (PerkinElmer). Measurements were performed by exciting the plates at 340 nM, and monitoring well fluorescence at 618 nm (Eu) and 671 nm (Cy5) with the ViewLux microplate reader .  To normalize data, values measured from both fluorescence emission wavelengths were used to calculate a ratio for each well, according to the following mathematical expression:  Ratio = ( I671nm / I618nm )  Where:  I represents the measured fluorescence emission intensity at the enumerated wavelength in nm.  The percent inhibition was calculated from the median ratio as follows:  %_Inhibition = 100 * ( ( Ratio_Test_Compound - Median_Ratio_Sample_Field ) / ( Median_Ratio_High_Control - Median_Ratio_Sample_Field) ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing test compound. High_Control is defined as wells containing HIV1-Integrase and DMSO. Low_Control is defined as wells containing HIV1-Integrase, vDNA, sDNA, LEDGF-p75 and DMSO Sample_Field is defined as wells containing HIV1-Integrase, vDNA, sDNA, LEDGF-p75 and compounds in DMSO  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Two values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested, and (2) three times their standard deviation. The sum of these two values was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.

Inflammasomes have been shown to contribute to the pathology of multiple autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as the Cryopryrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).  Patients with CAPS exhibit excessive production of IL-1B and IL-18 due to a gain-of-function mutation in NLRP3 [1], while COPD patients have elevated levels of IL-1B as a downstream consequence of inflammasome activation [2].  Anakinra has become the standard therapy for treating CAPS, but this drug has been shown to be inefficient because it relies on the stoichiometric scavenging of IL-1B rather than blocking inflammasome activation.  Hence, the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies for these chronic inflammatory diseases are of critical need.  A qHTS assay, based on AlphaLISA technology, was developed to screen the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) to look for novel inflammasome inhibitors.  The assay detects IL-1B using AlphaLISA anti-IL-1B acceptor and donor beads.  A decreased emission signal, indicating reduced IL-1B secretion, is the desired outcome for this assay.

NSD2 transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the lysine residue of the H4 peptide.  The enzyme reaction is allowed to proceed for 120 mins.  The assay uses an AlphaScreen technology as the detection mode.  The degree of lysine methylation is determined in the detection step when the Rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 (monomethyl K36) antibody reacts with the peptide methylated lysine group.  Subsequent binding of the streptavidin coated Donor bead to the biotinylated peptide and Protein A coated Acceptor bead binding to the anti-histone H3 (monomethyl K36) antibody results in Donor/Acceptor proximity.  Excitation at 680 nm enables Donor bead singlet oxygen transfer to the Acceptor bead that emmits light at 520-620 nm.  Expected Outcome: Active compounds inhibiting NSD2 are expected to give diminished methylation at H3K36 relative to controls and to decrease the measured alpha screen intensity.  Further orthogonal assays will determine which compounds are authentic inhibitors and which may be artifacts.","This assay is a 2-step procedure.

Description:  The key problem in HIV immunization is that many HIV epitopes that would be useful targets of neutralizing antibodies are weakly immunogenic in vivo. The only way high affinity neutralizing antibodies can be generated against some epitopes is by the induction of a high level of somatic hypermutation. Unfortunately no effective strategies exist today for reproducibly generating broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV either in healthy volunteers or in experimental animals (1-4). A few monoclonal and phage display derived antibodies have been described that have potent neutralization activity (5-10). Similar neutralizing antibodies are not readily generated upon immunization. Although HIV infected individuals can generate broadly neutralizing antibodies, these antibodies are generated too late in the course of an infection to be of mitigating clinical value. Broadly neutralizing antibodies generated in the course of natural infection are characterized by extensive somatic mutation (4). Thus, HIV immunization strategies for generating effective neutralization activity should have the goal of generating a range of extensively somatically mutated antibodies against a number of conserved but weakly immunogenic gp120 epitopes.  We have recently discovered an important mechanism of B cell tolerance that appears to dampen the activation of naive B cells whose antigen receptors recognize self or foreign antigens with moderate or low affinity (11). A key player in this B cell intrinsic suppressive pathway is Sialic Acid Acetyl Esterase (SIAE). This pathway swings into action only in peripheral B cells. Ongoing immunization studies in mice using adoptively transferred B cells deficient in SIAE strongly suggest that an SIAE inhibitor could be used to transiently lower the signaling threshold during an immunization window in order to appropriately activate B cells that recognize certain relatively low avidity epitopes and allow the development of immune responses that result in extensive somatic mutation of antibodies with the potential to effectively neutralize pathogens and their toxins. SIAE is therefore a very attractive molecule from the viewpoint of identifying a ""druggable"" enzyme target that regulates humoral immunity at the level of setting the threshold for the activation of peripheral B cells. Such an enzyme could potentially be a very interesting target for the pharmacological induction of immune activation in order to #empower# B cells that are specific for #weak# epitopes, and to also enhance T cell memory responses.

In this assay, SIAE protein is incubated with test compounds and fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-Rh) activity-based probe. The reaction is excited with linear polarized light and the intensity of the emitted light is measured as the polarization value (mP). As designed, test compounds that act as SIAE inhibitors will prevent SIAE-probe interactions, thereby increasing the proportion of free (unbound) fluorescent probe in the well, leading to low fluorescence polarization. Compounds are tested in singlicate at a nominal test concentration of 9.66 micromolar.  Protocol Summary:  Prior to the start of the assay, 3 microliters of assay buffer (1X DPBS and 0.01% Pluronic F-127) were dispensed into column 1 thru column 3 of 1536 microtiter plates. Next, 3 microliters of assay buffer containing 0.73uM of SIAE protein were dispensed into columns 4 thru 48. Then, 39 nL of test compound in DMSO or DMSO alone (0.97% final concentration) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 45 minutes at 25 degrees Celsius.  The assay was started by dispensing 1.0 microliter of 300 nM FP-Rh in assay buffer to all wells. Plates were centrifuged and after 120 minutes of incubation at 25 degrees Celsius, fluorescence polarization was read on a Viewlux microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland) using a BODIPY TMR FP filter set and a BODIPY dichroic mirror (excitation = 525nm, emission = 598nm) for 25 seconds for each polarization plane (parallel and perpendicular).  Prior to further calculations, the following formula was used to calculate fluorescence polarization (FP):  FP = ( Raw1 - Raw2 ) / ( Raw1 + Raw2 )  Where:  Raw1 is defined as the S channel. Raw2 is defined as the P channel.  The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated as follows:  100 *( ( Test_Compound - Median_Low_Control ) / ( Median_High_Control - Median_Low_Control ) )  Where:  Test_Compound is defined as wells containing SIAE protein in the presence of test compound and FP-Rh. High_Control is defined as wells containing DMSO, FP-Rh but, no SIAE protein. Low_Control is defined as the median of the wells containing test compounds.  PubChem Activity Outcome and Score:  A mathematical algorithm was used to determine nominally inhibiting compounds in the primary screen. Four values were calculated: (1) the average percent inhibition of all high controls tested plus three times the standard deviation of the high controls, (2) the average percent inhibition of all low controls tested minus three times the standard deviation of the low controls, (3) the average percent inhibition of all compounds tested between (1) and (2), and (4) three times their standard deviation. The sum of two of these values, (3) and (4), was used as a cutoff parameter, i.e. any compound that exhibited greater % inhibition/activity than the cutoff parameter was declared active.  The reported PubChem Activity Score has been normalized to 100% observed primary inhibition. Negative % inhibition values are reported as activity score zero.  The activity score range for active compounds is 100-2, for inactive 2-0.

One potential antibiotic target is the bacterial single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), which serves as a hub for DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Eight highly conserved residues at the C-terminus of SSB use direct protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to recruit more than a dozen important genome maintenance proteins to single-stranded DNA. Mutations that disrupt PPIs with the C-terminal tail of SSB are lethal, suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors of these critical SSB PPIs could be effective antibacterial agents. As a first step toward implementing this strategy, we have developed orthogonal high-throughput screening assays to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the Klebsiella pneumonia SSB-PriA interaction. Hits were identified from an initial screen of 72,474 compounds using an AlphaScreen (AS) primary screen, and their activity was subsequently confirmed in an orthogonal fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. As an additional control, an FP assay targeted against an unrelated eukaryotic PPI was used to confirm specificity for the SSB-PriA interaction. Nine potent and selective inhibitors produced concentration-response curves with IC50 values of <40 muM, and two compounds were observed to directly bind to PriA, demonstrating the success of this screen strategy.  After the manuscript was submitted an additional 27,537 compounds were screened. The data for these compounds is included in this upload. In July 2020 we added an additional data set of ~330,000 compounds from the MLPCN library that we run through this HTS.","SSBct-PriA AlphaScreen Assay Screening took place at the University of Wisconsin Small Molecule Screening Facility (SMSF). Controls and small molecules (stored as 10 mM DMSO stocks) were dispensed into 1536-well white plates (Nunc 253607, ThermoFisher) using an Echo 550 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) acoustic liquid handler. A Mantis liquid handler equipped with a high-volume silicone chip (Formulatrix, Bedford, MA) was used to add 3.0 muL of a master mix containing 10 mM HEPES-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1 micro M PriA, 0.1 micro M Bio-SSBct, and 5 microgram/mL AlphaScreen (AS) of both donor and acceptor beads (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) to each well of the plate. Master mix was prepared under diminished lighting immediately prior to dispensing. Plates were centrifuged briefly, rocked at room temperature for an hour, and then read using a PheraStar (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) plate reader using the following settings: 0.1 s settling time, 0.3 s excitation, and 0.6 s integration time with a 0.04 s delay between excitation and integration. Final concentrations of the positive (SSBct) and negative (DeltaFSSBct) controls were 25 micro M, and all compounds were tested at a final concentration of 33.3 micro M. Each screening plate contained 32 positive and negative control wells, 43 DMSO-only control wells, and a control SSBct concentration-response curve conducted in triplicate with SSBct concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 muM. For compound concentration-response curves, the requisite amount of each compound (at 10 mM in DMSO) was added to the wells and then backfilled with 100% DMSO so that each well contained a final DMSO concentration of 0.33% (v/v). AS master mix was then added to each well as before.",Data is reported as % inhibition.
